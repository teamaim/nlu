              "\"This appeal was heard by this Panel on 10 and 11 February 2010.\\nOn 14 April 2010, while we were still considering our decision upon it, we were asked to consider applications for permission to appeal in two other cases in which foreign national prisoners had been detained pending their deportation after completing their sentences of imprisonment.\\nWalumba Lumba, a citizen of the Democratic Republic of Congo, sought permission to appeal from a decision of the Court of Appeal [2010] EWCA Civ 111, [2010] 1 WLR 2168, dismissing his appeal from a decision of Collins J [2008] EWHC 2090 (Admin) on his claim for judicial review to refuse him a declaration that his detention by the Secretary of State for the Home Department was unlawful, for a mandatory order for his release and for damages.\\nMr Lumba together with Kadian Mighty, a citizen of Jamaica, also sought permission to appeal against the Court of Appeals decision dismissing their appeals from a decision of Davis J [2008] EWHC 3166 (Admin) to dismiss their claims for judicial review of the Secretary of States decision to detain them prior to their deportation and for damages for unlawful detention.\\nWe decided to give permission to appeal in both cases, and a direction was given that the appeals should be heard by a panel of nine Justices.\\nAs there was plainly a close relationship between the issues raised in those cases and this, we decided to withhold delivery of our judgments in this case until after the decision of nine Justices in the cases of Mr Lumba and Mr Mighty had been given.\\nFollowing the delivery of the judgment of their cases in R (Lumba) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2011] UKSC 12, [2011] 2 WLR 671 on 11 March 2011 the parties were invited to make written submissions in light of that judgment.\\nHaving received and considered their submissions, we are now in a position to give our judgment in this case.\\nThe appellant is a national of Zimbabwe.\\nHe entered the United Kingdom with leave as a visitor and was then given leave to remain for one year as a student.\\nBut he overstayed his leave and, following his conviction for several criminal offences, he was sentenced to a period of imprisonment.\\nThe Secretary of State decided that he should be deported.\\nOn 8 March 2006 he was detained pending the making of a deportation order.\\nHe remained in detention for 27 months until 13 June 2008 when he was released on bail by the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal.\\nOn 12 November 2007 while still detained he sought judicial review by means of a mandatory order for his immediate release, a declaration that he was unlawfully detained and damages.\\nOn 25 January 2008 Munby J granted a declaration that the appellant had been detained unlawfully for various distinct periods amounting to about 19 months and he gave directions for the assessment of damages: [2008] EWHC 98 (Admin).\\nBut he declined to make an order for his release.\\nThe Secretary of State appealed against the declaration.\\nThe appellant appealed against the refusal of an order for his release, but he was later granted bail and that appeal was not proceeded with.\\nOn 6 November 2008 the Court of Appeal (Laws, Keene and Longmore LJJ) allowed the Secretary of States appeal, holding that the appellants detention had been lawful throughout.\\nIt remitted a new point which had been raised about the legality of the appellants detention during periods when Munby J held that he was lawfully detained for determination by the High Court: [2008] EWCA Civ 1204, [2009] 1 WLR 1527.\\nThe appellant now appeals to this court against the decision by the Court of Appeal that he is not entitled to damages for false imprisonment.\\nAnonymity\\nThe appellant has been referred to hitherto in these proceedings as SK (Zimbabwe).\\nMr Tam QC for the respondent invited the court to maintain the order for the appellants anonymity in accordance with the practice for asylum cases recognised by the Court of Appeal.\\nHe suggested that references in the appellants application for asylum might expose him to risk if he were to be returned to Zimbabwe.\\nMr Husain for the appellant on the other hand did not ask for the order to be maintained.\\nHe did not suggest that there were any reasons for concern in his case.\\nHe said that he adopted a position of neutrality on this issue.\\nThere is no doubt that the court has power to make an anonymity order to restrain publication of a person named in its proceedings.\\nIn an extreme case, where he or his family are in peril of their lives or safety, this may help to secure his rights under articles 2 and 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights: In re Guardian News and Media Ltd [2010] UKSC 1, [2010] 2 WLR 325, para 26.\\nThose are the rights that are most likely to be relevant if he is seeking asylum.\\nIt may also be made to secure that other persons, such as the press, show respect for his private and family life under article 8 of the Convention.\\nBut in such cases the persons article 8 rights must be balanced against the article 10 rights of the press and the general public interest in his being identified: In re Guardian News and Media Ltd, para 76.\\nAs the decision in that case shows, however, much will depend on the circumstances of each case.\\nIt is no longer the case that all asylum seekers as a class are entitled to anonymity in this Court.\\nThe making of such an order has to be justified.\\nI am not persuaded that an order for the appellants anonymity is justified in this case.\\nIt must be recognised, of course, that lifting the order for his anonymity is not entirely without risk.\\nIt is rarely possible to predict with complete confidence what risks a failed asylum seeker will face when he is returned to his home country.\\nBut the position that the asylum seeker himself adopts will always be an important factor.\\nHe is likely to be in the best position to assess the risks and to say whether or not he needs anonymity for his protection.\\nHis counsel, Mr Husain, is very experienced in these matters and well able to form a sound judgment as to whether this is necessary or desirable.\\nI would have expected him to inform the court if there were any grounds at all for wishing to preserve the appellants anonymity.\\nHad he done so I would, of course, have given a good deal of weight to his submissions.\\nAs it is, in view of the position that he has adopted on the appellants behalf, I am not persuaded that there is anything to prevent his being identified in this case.\\nI would set aside the anonymity order, and name the appellant as Shepherd Masimba Kambadzi.\\nThe appellants case\\nThe context for the appellants claim of damages for false imprisonment is provided by the provisions for the regulation of entry and stay in the United Kingdom which are set out in Part 1 of the Immigration Act 1971, as amended.\\nHis case, put very simply, is that the discretionary power to detain that is vested in the Secretary of State by paragraphs 2(2) and (3) of Schedule 3 to the 1971 Act was not exercised throughout his period of detention in the way it should have been according to the published policy, that for periods when his detention was not reviewed in accordance with the policy it was not authorised and that he is entitled to damages for false imprisonment because his continued detention was unlawful during those periods.\\nA description of the statutory background and the system which, according to his own policy, the Secretary of State had undertaken to operate provides the starting point for an examination of this argument.\\nThe facts of this case are best understood in the light of that background.\\nThe statutory background\\nSection 4 of the 1971 Act provides that the power to give or refuse leave to enter the United Kingdom shall be exercised by immigration officers and that the power to give leave to remain in the United Kingdom, or to vary any leave, shall be exercised by the Secretary of State.\\nSection 3(5) renders a person who is not a British citizen liable to deportation if the Secretary of State deems his deportation to be conducive to the public good.\\nSection 4 gives effect to Schedule 2, paragraph 1(3) of which provides: In the exercise of their functions under this Act immigration officers shall act in accordance with such instructions (not inconsistent with the immigration rules) as may be given them by the Secretary of State.\\nSection 5(3) of the 1971 Act gives effect to Schedule 3 with respect to the removal from the United Kingdom of persons against whom deportation orders are in force and the detention and control of persons in connection with deportation.\\nParagraph 2 of Schedule 3 appears under the heading Detention or control pending deportation.\\nIt provides in subparagraphs (2) and (3): (2) Where notice has been given to a person in accordance with regulations under section 105 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (notice of decision) of a decision to make a deportation order against him, and he is not a detained person in pursuance of the sentence or order of a court, he may be detained under the authority of the Secretary of State pending the making of the deportation order. (3) Where a deportation order is in force against any person, he may be detained under the authority of the Secretary of State pending his removal or departure from the United Kingdom and if already detained by virtue of sub paragraph (1) or (2) above when the order is made, shall continue to be detained unless he is released on bail or the Secretary of State directs otherwise. [emphasis added]\\nAt first sight, the effect of paragraph 2(3) of the Schedule is that, once notice has been given of a decision to make a deportation order against him, the person may lawfully be detained until he is removed or departs.\\nBut, as Munby J observed in para 9 of his judgment, the powers conferred by those paragraphs are not unfettered.\\nIn R v Governor of Durham Prison, Ex p Hardial Singh [1984] 1 WLR 704, 706 Woolf J said: Although the power which is given to the Secretary of State in paragraph 2 to detain individuals is not subject to any express limitation of time, I am quite satisfied that it is subject to limitations.\\nFirst of all, it can only authorise detention if the individual is being detained pending his removal.\\nIt cannot be used for any other purpose.\\nSecondly, as the power is given in order to enable the machinery of deportation to be carried out, I regard the power of detention as being impliedly limited to a period which is reasonably necessary for that purpose.\\nThe period which is reasonable will depend upon the circumstances of the particular case.\\nWhat is more, if there is a situation where it is apparent to the Secretary of State that he is not going to be able to operate the machinery provided in the Act for removing persons who are intended to be deported within a reasonable period, it seems to me that it would be wrong for the Secretary of State to exercise his power of detention.\\nIn addition, I would regard it as implicit that the Secretary of State should exercise all reasonable expedition to ensure that the steps are taken which will be necessary to ensure the removal of the individual within a reasonable time.\\nThis statement was referred to with approval in Tan Te Lam v Superintendent of Tai A Chau Detention Centre [1997] AC 97.\\nLord Browne Wilkinson said of the power to detain pending removal in the Hong Kong Ordinance at p 111A D: Their Lordships have no doubt that in conferring such a power to interfere with individual liberty, the legislature intended that such power could only be exercised reasonably and that accordingly it was implicitly so limited.\\nThe principles enunciated by Woolf J in the Hardial Singh case [1984] 1 WLR 704 are statements of the limitations on a statutory power of detention pending removal.\\nIn the absence of contrary indications in the statute which confers the power to detain pending removal their Lordships agree with the principles stated by Woolf J.\\nIn A v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2004] UKHL 56, [2005] 2 AC 68, para 8 Lord Bingham of Cornhill said that Woolf Js guidance in Hardial Singh had never been questioned.\\nIn R (I) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2002] EWCA Civ 888, [2003] INLR 196, para 46, Dyson LJ said that counsel had correctly submitted that the following four principles (the Hardial Singh principles) emerge from it: (i) The Secretary of State must intend to deport the person and can only use the power to detain for that purpose; (ii) The deportee may only be detained for a period that is reasonable in all the circumstances; (iii) If, before the expiry of the reasonable period, it becomes apparent that the Secretary of State will not be able to effect deportation within that reasonable period, he should not seek to exercise the power of detention; (iv) The Secretary of State should act with reasonable diligence and expedition to effect removal.\\nIt was common ground in R (Lumba) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2011] 2 WLR 671 that in this passage the effect of Woolf Js judgment was correctly summarised and it was approved as an accurate statement of the relevant principles: see, eg, paras 171 174.\\nAs Lady Hale said at para 199, the detention must be for the statutory purposes of making or implementing a deportation order and for no other purpose.\\nThe cases were reviewed by Lord Brown of Eaton under Heywood in R (Khadir) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2005] UKHL 39, [2006] 1 AC 207, where the power to detain was exercised under Schedule 2 in the context of removing those refused leave to enter.\\nLord Brown said that, while it went without saying that the longer the delay in effecting someones removal the more difficult it becomes to justify the continued detention meanwhile, that was by no means to say that he does not remain liable to detention: para 31.\\nIn para 33 he said: To my mind the Hardial Singh line of cases says everything about the exercise of the power to detain (when it properly can be exercised and when it cannot); nothing about its existence.\\nThis case is about the way in which the power to detain can properly be exercised, but it raises issues about the existence of the power too.\\nDoes the Secretary of States failure to comply with his published policy for regular reviews to monitor changing circumstances deprive him of his executive power to continue to detain the detainee? Or does his power continue until a review shows that continued detention is no longer appropriate? I think that an examination of the Hardial Singh principles may help to resolve these questions, as they give rise to the need for these reviews.\\nBut it is clear that the appellant cannot succeed in his claim by relying solely on those principles.\\nMr Husain for the appellant submits that, while the Secretary of States decision to detain was lawful at its inception, it could become unlawful with the passage of time.\\nThere was no challenge to the judges findings that throughout the period that the appellant was detained the Hardial Singh principles were complied with.\\nIn the Court of Appeal Laws LJ said that the judge was entitled to be so satisfied: [2009] 1 WLR 1527, para 36.\\nBut Mr Husains case is that the matter does not rest there.\\nHe says that the Secretary of States published policy also regulates the existence of the power to continue detention, and that it must be followed in the absence of good reason not to do so.\\nThe published policy\\nBefore I come to the published policy I should mention that the Secretary of State was given power by the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 to make rules for the regulation and management of detention centres.\\nRule 9 of the Detention Centre Rules 2001 (SI 2001/238) provides: (1) Every detained person will be provided, by the Secretary of State, with written reasons for his detention at the time of his initial decision, and thereafter monthly. (2) The Secretary of State shall, within a reasonable time following any request to do so by a detained person, provide that person with an update on the progress of any relevant matter relating to him.\\nRule 9(3) sets out a list of relevant matters for the purposes of that paragraph.\\nIn the Court of Appeal, para 45, Keene LJ said that it was clearly implicit in the rule that the Secretary of State has to reconsider the justification for detention, month by month, in the light of changing circumstances.\\nAt para 46 he said: The need for such regular reviews stems from the necessity for the Secretary of State to monitor changing circumstances in a given case lest his power to detain, on the principles set out in Ex p Hardial Singh [1984] 1 WLR 704, no longer exists.\\nEven if the power still exists, he has a discretion to exercise which he must also keep under review.\\nThe importance of the detainee receiving regular statements of the reason why he is still detained is self evident: he needs to be in a position to know whether he can properly challenge the Secretary of States decision in the courts by way of an application for habeas corpus or judicial review or whether he can apply for bail on a meaningful basis.\\nSo the requirements imposed by rule 9 cannot be treated lightly, especially when one is dealing with administrative detention which deprives a person of his liberty without a court order.\\nI agree with these observations, but I would prefer to apply them to the system of review that is set out in the policy rather than to the system required by rule 9(1).\\nThis is because it seems to me that the 2001 Rules are concerned with the regulation and management of detention centres, not with the way the discretion to detain is exercised.\\nThis is what the explanatory note says, and I think that Keene LJ was right to conclude in para 47 that rule 9(1) is not concerned with limiting the Secretary of States power to detain.\\nIn any event the appellant was detained in prison conditions to which the Rules do not apply for the first 14 months of the period of his detention.\\nIt was not until April 2007 that he was moved to a detention centre and the Rules applied to his case.\\nI come then to the Secretary of States policy.\\nIt is to be found in a document issued by the Home Office called the Operations Enforcement Manual.\\nVarious versions of this manual have been existence since at least 2001.\\nMr Tam informed the Court that it was safe to proceed on the basis that the version used in these proceedings, which was downloaded in 2007, was the one that was in circulation while the appellant was being held in detention.\\nChapter 38 of the manual is entitled Detention and Temporary Release.\\nIt is here that the published policies regulating the exercise of the Secretary of States discretion, in accordance with the Hardial Singh principles, are set out.\\nParagraph 38.1, headed Policy refers to the 1998 White Paper Fairer, Faster and Firmer: a Modern Approach to Immigration and Asylum (1998) (Cm 4018) in which it was said there was a presumption in favour of temporary admission or release and that detention would most usually be appropriate to effect removal, initially to establish a persons identity or basis of claim or where there is reason to believe that the person will fail to comply with any conditions attached to the grant of temporary admission or release.\\nIt refers also to the 2002 White Paper Secure Borders, Safe Haven: Integration with Diversity in Modern Britain (2002) (Cm 5687) in which the principles stated in the 1998 White Paper were reiterated.\\nThese criteria are said to represent the Governments stated policy on the use of detention.\\nThere then follows this important acknowledgement of the significance of the policy in public law: To be lawful, detention must not only be based on one of the statutory powers and accord with the limitations implied by domestic and Strasbourg case law but must also accord with this stated policy. [emphasis added] Under the sub heading Use of Detention these words appear: In all cases detention must be used sparingly, and for the shortest period necessary.\\nParagraph 38.3 is headed Factors influencing a decision to detain (excluding pre decision fast track cases).\\nIt contains the following instructions: 1.\\nThere is a presumption in favour of temporary admission or temporary release. 2.\\nThere must be strong grounds for believing that a person will not comply with conditions of temporary admission or temporary release for detention to be justified. 3.\\nAll reasonable alternatives to detention must be considered before detention is authorised. 4.\\nOnce detention has been authorised it must be kept under close review to ensure that it continues to be justified. 5.\\nEach case must be considered on its individual merits.\\nVarious factors which must be taken into account when considering the need for initial or continued detention are then set out.\\nThey include, among other things, the likelihood of the person being removed and, if so, after what timescale; whether there is any history of previous absconding or of failure to comply with conditions of temporary release or bail; and whether there is a previous history of complying with the requirements of immigration control.\\nParagraph 38.5 is headed Levels of authority for detention.\\nIt states: Although the power in law to detain an illegal entrant rests with the [immigration officer], or the relevant non warranted immigration caseworker under the authority of the Secretary of State, in practice, an officer of at least [Chief Immigration Officer] rank, or a senior caseworker, must give authority.\\nDetention must then be reviewed at regular intervals (see 38.8).\\nParagraph 38.5.2 states that the decision as to whether a person subject to deportation action should be detained under Immigration Act powers is taken by a senior caseworker in the Criminal Casework Directorate.\\nParagraph 38.6 is headed Detention Forms.\\nThe opening sentence states: The Government stated in the 1998 White Paper that written reasons for detention should be given in all cases at the time of detention and thereafter at monthly intervals. [emphasis in the original] The authority to detain is known as Form IS91.\\nParagraph 38.6.1, which is headed Form IS91RA Risk Assessment, states: Once it has been identified that the person is one who should be detained, consideration should be given as to what, if any, level of risk that person may present whilst in detention. [Immigration officers] should undertake the checks detailed on form IS91RA part A Risk Factors (in advance, as far as possible, in a planned operation/visit when it is anticipated detention will be required.\\nParagraph 38.6.2, which is headed Form IS9I Authority to Detain, states that once the Detainee Escorting and Population Management Unit has decided on the location for detention they will forward a form to the detaining office detailing the detention location and the assessment of risk, which is attached to form IS91 and served on the detaining agent.\\nIf there is an alteration in risk factors a new form IS91 is issued.\\nParagraph 38.8 is headed Detention Reviews.\\nIt is on its provisions that the appellants argument that from time to time during the period of his detention he was detained unlawfully depends.\\nIt identifies the grade of officer by whom initial detention must be authorised.\\nIt then states: Continued detention in all cases of persons in sole detention under Immigration Act powers must be subject to administrative review at regular intervals.\\nAt each review robust and formally documented consideration should be given to the removability of the detainee.\\nA formal and documented review of detention should be made after 24 hours by an Inspector and thereafter, as directed, at the 7, 14, 21 and 28 day points.\\nAt the 14 day stage, or if circumstances change between weekly reviews an Inspector must conduct the review.\\nIn [the Criminal Casework Directorate] an [higher executive officer] reviews detention up to 2 months. [A senior executive officer/Her Majestys inspector] reviews detention up to 4 months, the Assistant Director/Grade 7 up to 8 months, the Deputy Director up to 11 months and the Director up to 12 months and over. [emphasis in the original]\\nThe facts\\nThe appellant arrived in this country on 30 October 2002 as a visitor with six months leave to enter.\\nOn 9 May 2003 he applied for leave to remain for two years as a student.\\nHe was granted leave for one year until 30 April 2004.\\nAfter that date he remained here without leave.\\nOn 9 December 2005 he was convicted on two counts of common assault and one count of sexual assault on a female.\\nHe was sentenced to 12 months imprisonment and ordered to be registered as a sex offender for five years.\\nThe judge did not recommend deportation.\\nBut on 7 March 2006, the day before he was due to be released from prison after serving six months of his sentence including time spent on remand, the Secretary of State decided to make a deportation order against him.\\nHe was detained under paragraph 2(2) of Schedule 3 to the 1971 Act and remained in custody at HMP Woodhill.\\nOn 24 March 2006 the appellant claimed asylum.\\nOn 11 April 2006 he asked the Secretary of State to move him from the prison to a detention centre, but his request was ignored.\\nOn 18 April 2006 the Citizens Advice Bureau wrote two letters to the Secretary of State on his behalf.\\nIn one it requested his urgent transfer to a detention centre.\\nIn the other it appealed against the notice of decision to make a deportation order.\\nOn 20 April 2006 and again on 3 May 2006 the Citizens Advice Bureau wrote to the Secretary of State on the appellants behalf contending that his continued detention was unlawful.\\nMunby J said in para 19(xvi) that these letters were clearly relying upon the Hardial Singh principles, but they went unanswered.\\nOn 17 May 2006 the appellant, who had now been moved to HMP Lincoln, applied for bail.\\nHis application was refused on 19 May 2006.\\nHe applied for bail again on 15 September 2006.\\nOn 19 September 2006 the Secretary of State refused his application for asylum.\\nTwo days later, on 21 September 2006, the Asylum and Immigration Appeals Tribunal heard his appeals against the decision to deport, the refusal of asylum and a refusal to grant him relief on human rights grounds.\\nThe tribunal refused bail, having noted that he had previously committed an offence under the Bail Act 1976.\\nOn 4 October 2006 the Tribunal issued its decision dismissing all three appeals.\\nIt stated that the appellant, believing that he had a poor case in resisting deportation, had sought to bolster his prospects of success by inventing a false claim and that the Secretary of State was right to conclude that his deportation was necessary as the offences which he had committed were serious and he had been assessed as presenting a medium risk of sexual or violent offending upon his release.\\nOn 4 May 2007 he was moved from HMP Lincoln to Campsfield Immigration Removal Centre.\\nOn 6 July 2007, following a hearing for the reconsideration of his appeals that had been ordered in January 2007, the tribunal refused his appeals following reconsideration.\\nOn 24 August 2007 a deportation order was made and served on the appellant.\\nAs the appellant is a national of Zimbabwe, it is to Zimbabwe that the Secretary of State proposes to deport him.\\nBut two years previously on 4 August 2005 Collins J ordered by consent that removal of 30 Zimbabweans be suspended pending resolution of the issue in a test case, and the enforced return of failed Zimbabwean asylum seekers was suspended by the Secretary of State.\\nThe position as at the date of the hearing of this appeal was that no enforced returns of Zimbabwean failed asylum seekers had taken place since that date.\\nBy a letter dated 8 March 2006 the appellant was informed that he was to be detained and that his detention would be reviewed on a regular basis.\\nIf the reviews had been carried out in accordance with the policy set out in paragraph 38.8 of the manual they would have occurred on 10 March 2006 (after 24 hours), 16 March 2006 (7 days), 23 March 2006 (14 days), 30 March 2006 (21 days) and 6 April 2006 (28 days).\\nThey would have been carried out thereafter at monthly intervals.\\nAs to the monthly reviews, the paragraph 38.8 provides that the first two monthly reviews must be carried out by a Higher Executive Officer, the next two by a Senior Executive Officer or one of Her Majestys Inspectors, the next four by an Assistant Director or Grade 7 civil servant, the next three by a Deputy Director and, in the case of the monthly reviews in the second year of detention, by a Director.\\nBy the date of the hearing before Munby J the appellant had been entitled to 22 monthly reviews of the lawfulness of his detention in addition to the initial five reviews in the first month.\\nIn the event he had had only 10 reviews up to the date of the hearing.\\nOf these, only six were conducted by officials of the required seniority.\\nOf these, two were disavowed by the Secretary of State as flawed by material errors of fact.\\nThe details of the Secretary of States failure to carry out reviews at the required frequency and by the appropriate persons are set in the judgment of Munby J at paras 43 51 and 124 127 and in paras 11 13 of the judgment of the Court of Appeal.\\nThe judge described the picture that emerged from his analysis of the Secretary of States file as deeply disturbing and profoundly shocking.\\nThe Secretary of State has acknowledged that reviews should have been carried out.\\nHe has not sought to justify or excuse in any way their absence in the appellants case.\\nHe also accepts that these failures cannot be extenuated by the appellants own bad character or his previous conduct.\\nIt is now known, following disclosures that were made prior to the hearing of R (WL) Congo v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2010] EWCA Civ 111, [2010] 1 WLR 2168 by the Court of Appeal, that from April 2006 to September 2008 the Home Office applied an unpublished detention policy to all foreign national prisoners following the completion of their prison sentences pending their deportation.\\nThis followed the revelation on 25 April 2006 that during the past seven years over 1,000 such prisoners had been released from prison on completion of their sentences without being considered for deportation or deported.\\nIllegal migrants and paedophiles, a toxic mix.\\nThe tabloids will go bananas.\\nThe words of a contemporary diarist, Chris Mullin, Decline and Fall (2010), p 94, capture the atmosphere of disaster that was engendered among ministers by this announcement.\\nA few days later Charles Clarke was removed from his post and was replaced on 4 May 2006 as Home Secretary by Dr John Reid.\\nA practice of blanket detention was then instituted with a ruthless determination that precluded consideration of the merits of any individual case and was wholly at odds with the presumption in the published policy in favour of temporary admission or temporary release.\\nIt remained in place until November 2007 when it was replaced by another unpublished policy which permitted release only in exceptional circumstances.\\nIt was not until 9 September 2008 that a revised detention policy was published.\\nThis course of events may explain the Secretary of States failure to carry out reviews at the required frequency and by the appropriate persons in the appellants case.\\nBut his case has been conducted throughout so far on the basis that the policy that was being applied to him was the published policy.\\nThe new issues that he has raised in light of these disclosures are presently stayed for determination by the High Court: see Laws LJ [2009] 1 WLR 1527, paras 42 44.\\nThe issues\\nMunby J held that the appellant was unlawfully detained for the periods which he specified by reason of the Secretary of States failures to carry out the reviews required by rule 9(1) and the manual.\\nThe basis for that finding is to be found in the following passage in his judgment [2008] EWHC 98 (Admin), para 68: Integral to the scheme endorsed by Parliament in its approval of rule 9(1) of the Detention Centre Rules 2001, and integral to the policy laid down by the Secretary of State in paragraph 38.8 of the Operations Enforcement Manual, is the principle that someone is not to be detained beyond a certain period without there being a review undertaken at regular intervals and moreover, as required by the Secretary of States policy, a review undertaken at increasing high levels of seniority within the Home Office as the period of detention grows.\\nThose reviews are fundamental to the propriety of the continuing detention, they are required in order to ensure that the continuing detention can still be justified in the light of current, and perhaps, changed circumstances, and they are, in my judgment, a necessary prerequisite to the continuing legality of the detention.\\nIn para 122 he said that, to the extent that the appellants detention had been unlawful as a matter of domestic law it had also, by parity of reasoning, been unlawful by virtue of section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998, and that there was nothing in the circumstances of his case to give him a remedy under section 6 where there would not be a remedy under domestic law.\\nSo in practical terms the claim under article 5 of the Convention added nothing.\\nIn the Court of Appeal Laws LJ said that the issue was one of statutory construction: [2009] 1 WLR 1527, para 21.\\nEx p Hardial Singh showed that paragraph 2(2) of Schedule 3 to the 1971 Act was subject to implied limitations.\\nThe question, as he saw it, was whether a further limitation was to be found such that on a proper construction of paragraph 2(2) the power was subject to compliance with the rule and the manual: para 23.\\nSummarising his conclusions, with which the other members of the court agreed, he said that compliance with the rules and the manual as such was not a condition precedent to a lawful decision pursuant to paragraph 2(2): para 25.\\nThe statute did not make it so, nor did the common law or the Convention.\\nThe Hardial Singh principles had to be complied with, but this was subject to control by the courts, principally by way of judicial review.\\nIn that event the particular context would be the vindication of those principles, but in this case it was plain that the appellant was held in compliance with them throughout the period of his detention.\\nMr Husain accepted that the Hardial Singh principles had throughout been complied with.\\nOn the other hand there had been repeated failures to comply with the system of review set out in the manual.\\nParagraph 38.8 of the manual states that continued detention in all cases under Immigration Act powers must be subject to administrative review at regular intervals.\\nThese reviews were essential to the continued legality of the exercise by the Secretary of State of his discretion to detain.\\nHe accepted that not all public law errors or policy defaults will render detention unlawful.\\nThe question will always be whether the error is sufficiently linked to the decision to detain or to continue detention.\\nIn this case the reviews required by the policy must be seen as the authority on which continued legality of the detention rests.\\nHe accepted that if his case were to succeed at common law his case under article 5 would not add anything.\\nBut in case it were necessary to address this argument he submitted that the appellant was entitled to the implied protections prescribed by article 5(1)(f).\\nThere had been a clear breach of national procedural rules because the Secretary of State had failed to comply with the rules and with the published policy, which he was required to follow unless there were good reasons not to do so.\\nThis was irrespective of whether the requirements that had been breached were conditions precedent to the exercise of the power to detain.\\nAs to the effect of the decision in Lumba, Mr Husain submitted that it was now clear that it was not a defence for the Secretary of State to show that the detention complied with the Hardial Singh principles and the requirements of the statute.\\nNor was it a defence for him to show that had the public law error not been committed the detainee would have been detained in any event.\\nThe serial failure to conduct the proper detention reviews was a material public law error, as it was essential to the legality of a temporarily unlimited and otherwise unchecked power to continue detention.\\nThe initial detention authority by the Secretary of States executive order was to be contrasted with orders to detain by a court.\\nThe reviews were an important safeguard.\\nThe failure to conduct them amounted, on the facts of this case, to an abuse of the power to detain.\\nFor the Secretary of State Mr Tam accepted that the Hardial Singh principles imposed implied limits on the exercise of the powers of detention that were set out in the statute.\\nBut he submitted that there was no provision or rule that limited the Secretary of States authority to detain in any other way.\\nThings had not been done, probably in violation of his duty in public law, for which legal remedies might have been available.\\nBut the claim in this case was a very specific one.\\nThe question was not whether there had been a breach of the law.\\nThe appellant was seeking damages for false imprisonment.\\nThere was no basis for such a claim, as the detention was at all times within the original authority to detain under the powers that were to be found in the statute.\\nThat would have been plain from the documents that were available in his case had his continued detention had been challenged by judicial review.\\nIn the light of the judgments in Lumba, the central question for the court was whether each relevant breach of the procedural requirement to review detention was material in public law terms, that is to say whether it bore on and was relevant to the decision to detain.\\nThere was a difference between a requirement that was procedural only and a failure to apply a substantive rule which was capable of affecting the decision to detain or not to detain.\\nA pure omission to review detention at the times specified by the policy was not material, at least in a case such as this where, had the review been carried out, the application of the substantive rules would have resulted in a decision to continue detention.\\nBut he accepted that if that submission was rejected, an omission to make a new decision by way of a detention review which was material in the Lumba sense must inevitably have the effect that the next period of detention was not authorised and the tort of false imprisonment was made out.\\nThe common law remedy\\nThe issue as to whether the appellant is entitled to damages, as focussed by these arguments, is a narrow one.\\nIt is common ground that the appellant was lawfully detained at the outset, as his detention was with a view to the making of a deportation order.\\nThere was a serious breakdown thereafter in the system of reviews mandated by the manual.\\nBut it is also common ground, as the judge found, that the Hardial Singh principles were complied with throughout the entire period.\\nAs Mr Tam points out, the continued detention could at all times have been justified by the Secretary of State had he been faced with an application for judicial review.\\nUntil 24 August 2007, when the deportation order was made and served on the appellant, the appellant was being detained under paragraph 2(2) pending the making of a deportation order.\\nFrom that date onwards he was being detained under paragraph 2(3) because he had not been released on bail and the Secretary of State had not directed otherwise.\\nOn the other hand Mr Tam accepts that the breakdown in the system was a breach of a duty owed by the Secretary of State to the appellant in public law.\\nThe appellant could have obtained a mandatory order at any time requiring the reviews to be carried out if he had asked for this.\\nThe focus of attention therefore is on the authority to detain.\\nIs the review essential to the legality of the continued detention? Or is it a sufficient answer to the claim for damages for the Secretary of State to say that, unless and until he directed otherwise, the authority to detain is there throughout in terms of the statute? I have not found this an easy question to answer.\\nI do not accept the Court of Appeals view that the question is one of statutory construction.\\nWe are dealing in this case with what the Secretary of State agrees are public law duties which are not set out in the statute.\\nOf course it is for the courts, not the Secretary of State, to say what the effect of the statements in the manual actually is.\\nBut there is a substantial body of authority to the effect that under domestic public law the Secretary of State is generally obliged to follow his published detention policy.\\nIn R (Saadi) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2001] EWCA Civ 1512, [2002] 1 WLR 356, para 7, Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers MR, delivering the judgment of the court, said that lawful exercise of statutory powers can be restricted, according to established principles of public law, by government policy and the legitimate expectation to which such policy gives rise.\\nIn Nadarajah v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2003] EWCA Civ 1768, [2004] INLR 139, para 54 the Master of the Rolls, again delivering the judgment of the court, said: Our domestic law comprehends both the provisions of Schedule 2 to the Immigration Act 1971 and the Secretary of States published policy, which, under principles of public law, he is obliged to follow.\\nIn D v Home Office (Bail for Immigration Detainees intervening) [2005] EWCA Civ 38, [2006] 1 WLR 1003, para 132 Brooke LJ said that what the law requires is that the policies for administrative detention are published and that immigration officers do not stray outside the four corners of those policies when taking decisions in individual cases.\\nWade and Forsyth, Administrative Law 10th ed, (2009), pp 315 316 states that the principle that policy must be consistently applied is not in doubt and that the courts now expect government departments to honour their statements of policy.\\nPolicy is not law, so it may be departed from if a good reason can be shown.\\nBut it has not been suggested that there was a good reason for the failure of officials of the required seniority to review the detention in this case and to do so in accordance with the prescribed timetable.\\nMr Husain submitted that the effect of the statements in the manual was not just to create a legitimate expectation that the reviews would be carried out.\\nHe said that, as the discretion to detain under the statute had to be exercised reasonably according to the Hardial Singh principles, the authority for continued detention was dependent on decisions taken each time it was reviewed.\\nMoreover an unlawful detention was not rendered lawful because there were circumstances that might have made it lawful.\\nHe sought support for that proposition in Clarke LJs observation in Roberts v Chief Constable of the Cheshire Constabulary [1999] 1 WLR 662, 666, that the detention in that case was unlawful because it was not reviewed until some event occurred to make it lawful.\\nBut that was a case where the plaintiff was detained under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, section 34(1) of which provided that a person arrested for an offence shall not be kept in detention except in accordance with the provisions of Part IV of the Act.\\nSection 40, which was in Part IV, required reviews of the detention of person police custody at stated intervals.\\nIt was clear, as Clarke LJ said in the passage at p 666 that Mr Husain referred to, that the plaintiff was not being detained in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Act.\\nAs Mr Husain pointed out, the Secretary of State accepts that where the authorising statute provides that a particular procedural step is a precondition to the legality of the detention a failure to carry out the required step means that the detention is unlawful and entitles the detainee to damages for false imprisonment.\\nThat is what was decided in Roberts v Chief Constable of the Cheshire Constabulary [1999] 1 WLR 662.\\nBut that case, as Mr Tam put it, was all about the statute.\\nThe situation in this case is quite different, as there is no mention of the need for reviews in relevant paragraphs in the authorising statute.\\nI agree with both Laws LJ in the Court of Appeal, para 25, and Lord Brown (see para 100, below), that Roberts provides little, if any, assistance on the effect of the Secretary of States failure to comply with his published policy.\\nOn the other hand the appellants argument that where the published policy is departed from the detention is unlawful finds some support in Nadarajah v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2004] INLR 139.\\nTwo appeals were before the court in that case.\\nThe appellants had both been detained on the ground that their removal from the United Kingdom was imminent.\\nThe Secretary of States published policy was not to treat removal as imminent once proceedings which challenged the right to remove had been initiated.\\nIt was also the policy of the immigration service when considering the imminence of removal to disregard information from those acting for asylum seekers that proceedings were about to be initiated.\\nBut this policy had not been made public and it was held that the Secretary of State could not rely on it.\\nIn para 54 the Master of the Rolls, Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers, said that he was obliged to follow his published policy.\\nAsking itself the question whether the appellants detention had been lawful, the court held that it was not.\\nIn para 68, referring to Nadarajahs case, Lord Phillips said: The only basis upon which the Immigration Service could treat his removal as imminent was by applying that aspect of the Secretary of States policy which had not been made public, namely that no regard would be paid to an intimation that judicial review proceedings would be instituted.\\nThe Secretary of State cannot rely upon this aspect of his policy as rendering lawful that which was, on the face of it, at odds with his policy, as made public.\\nIn other words, it was unlawful for him to depart from his published policy unless there were good reasons for doing so.\\nIn para 72, referring to the case of the other appellant, he said that his detention was unlawful for the same reason as Nadarajahs detention was unlawful.\\nIn consequence of that decision he was entitled to damages: see para 15.\\nIn Mohammed Holgate v Duke [1984] AC 437, 443, Lord Diplock said that the Wednesbury principles are applicable not only in proceedings for judicial review but also for the purpose of founding a cause of action at common law for trespass by false imprisonment.\\nIt may be that not every public law error will justify resort to the common law remedy in every case.\\nBut I do not think that it is necessary to show that there was bad faith or that the discretion was exercised for an improper purpose in the present context.\\nWhere there is an executive discretion to detain someone without limit of time, the right to liberty demands that the cause of action should be available if the discretion has not been lawfully exercised.\\nIn R v Deputy Governor of Parkhurst Prison, Ex p Hague [1992] 1 AC 58 Lord Bridge of Harwich said that the tort of false imprisonment has two ingredients: the fact of imprisonment and the absence of lawful authority to justify it.\\nThe requirements of the 1971 Act and Hardial Singh principles are not the only applicable law with which the Secretary of State must comply.\\nNadarajahs case shows that lawful authority for an executive power of detention may also be absent when there is a departure from the executives published policy.\\nAs Lord Brown points out, the published policy in Nadarajahs case entitled the detainee to release because it narrowed the grounds on which the power of detention was exercisable: para 107, below.\\nIn this case the policy was different because it was concerned not with the grounds for detention but with procedure.\\nAll it did was to provide that the detention would be reviewed by designated officers at regular intervals.\\nOf course I agree with him that the policies are different.\\nBut I do not think that this difference means that Nadarajah offers no assistance in this case.\\nOn the contrary, it seems to me to indicate that a failure by the executive to adhere to its published policy without good reason can amount to an abuse of power which renders the detention itself unlawful.\\nI use this expression to describe a breach of public law which bears directly on the discretionary power that the executive is purporting to exercise.\\nThe importance of the principle that the executive must act within the law was emphasised by Lord Bingham in his seminal Sir David Williams lecture, The Rule of Law [2007] CLJ 67, 72, when he said: The broader and more loosely textured a discretion is, whether conferred on an official or a judge, the greater the scope for subjectivity and hence for arbitrariness, which is the antithesis of the rule of law.\\nThis sub rule requires that a discretion should ordinarily be narrowly defined and its exercise capable of reasoned justification.\\nThat is a proposition which can be applied to this case.\\nThe published policy narrowed the power of executive detention by requiring that it be reviewed regularly.\\nThis was necessary to meet the objection that, unless it was implemented in accordance with a published policy, the power of executive detention was being applied in a manner that was arbitrary.\\nSo it was an abuse of the power for the detainee to be detained without his detention being reviewed at regular intervals.\\nApplying the test proposed by Lord Dyson in Lumba, it was an error which bore on and was relevant to the decision to detain throughout the period when the reviews should have been carried out: [2011] 2 WLR 671, para 68.\\nThe authorities relied on by the Secretary of State\\nMr Tam referred to a series of cases where detention was held not to be unlawful despite errors of public law.\\nIn R v Deputy Governor of Parkhurst Prison, Ex p Hague [1992] 1 AC 58 the appellant Hague had been segregated under a procedure which was not lawful which it was claimed amounted to false imprisonment, and another prisoner named Weldon claimed that he had been falsely imprisoned and battered by certain prison officers.\\nThose claims were rejected, in short because the sentence of imprisonment provided lawful authority for the prisoners detention, that this could not be read as subject to any implied term with respect to the prison rules and that an otherwise lawful detention was not rendered unlawful by the conditions of detention.\\nMr Tam said that it was authority for the view that a public law error made in relation to a persons detention may entitle the person to seek judicial review but does not necessarily give rise to a remedy in damages.\\nI would not quarrel with that proposition, but it begs the question whether the present case is one where a remedy in damages is available.\\nCullen v Chief Constable of the Royal Ulster Constabulary [2003] UKHL 39, [2003] 1 WLR 1763 was a case about the right of access to a solicitor.\\nThe appellant was arrested under section 14(1)(b) of the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act 1982.\\nHe asked to see a solicitor but his right to do so was deferred while he was in police custody.\\nIn contravention of the relevant statute the deferral was made before the appellant requested access and he was not given the reasons for delaying access.\\nHe claimed damages for false imprisonment.\\nLord Hutton said in para 48 that he saw no substance in this submission as he had been lawfully arrested and after his arrest was lawfully detained under the provisions of the statute.\\nThe premature authorisation and the breach of the requirement for reasons to be given did not render the detention unlawful.\\nLord Millett said in para 61 that compliance was not a condition of lawful detention.\\nThis decision indicates that the critical question is likely to be whether breaches of this kind undermine the lawful authority for the detention.\\nOn the view that was taken of the statute that applied in that case, they did not.\\nThe facts of this case, which concerns the Secretary of States discretion to maintain detention in accordance with his published policy, are quite different.\\nIn R (Saadi) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2002] UKHL 41, [2002] 1 WLR 3131, which was concerned with the lawfulness of detention under paragraphs 2(1) and 16(1) of Schedule 2 to the 1971 Act, Lord Slynn of Hadley said at para 48 that the Secretary of States giving of no or wrong reasons did not affect the legality of the detention.\\nMr Tam said that no hint was given in that case that this failure gave rise to a problem as to its legality.\\nBut Collins J said that it was not argued in that case that the muddle about reasons rendered the decision to detain unlawful: [2001] EWCA Civ 1512, [2002] 1 WLR 356, para 16.\\nNor was the effect of a failure to review in issue.\\nIn R (Munjaz) v Mersey Care NHS Trust [2003] EWCA Civ 1036, [2004] QB 395 two psychiatric patients challenged the lawfulness of the policy on seclusion that was applied in their respective hospitals.\\nReferring to what was decided in R v Deputy Governor of Parkhurst Prison, Ex p Hague [1992] 1 AC 58, Hale LJ said that a person who had been deprived of his liberty in pursuance of a lawful power to detain cannot through the medium of a tort of false imprisonment complain about the conditions in which he is detained, at least by those who are lawfully detaining him: para 49.\\nThere had been a breach of the statutory code of practice, but this did not amount to false imprisonment: para 82.\\nMr Tam said that these observations supported his argument.\\nBut he accepts that Hague, Cullen and Munjaz were not concerned with the question whether the person concerned should be detained at all, but only with the conditions of detention (Hague and Munjaz) or the ancillary matter of legal advice while in detention (Cullen).\\nIt should also be noted that in Munjaz, para 77, Hale LJ said that if an individual decision has been taken unlawfully in public law terms and results in actions which are tortious if taken without lawful excuse, then tortious remedies will be available.\\nThe context is different, of course.\\nAnd the claim for a remedy under the tort of false imprisonment was rejected.\\nBut her observation is entirely consistent with what was said in Nadarajah v Secretary of State for the Home Department: see para 39, above.\\nThe question as to the lawfulness of continued detention was directly in issue in R (Walker) v Secretary of State for Justice (Parole Board intervening) [2009] UKHL 22, [2010] 1 AC 553.\\nThat case arose out of the Secretary of States failure to provide the systems and resources that prisoners serving indeterminate sentences for public protection needed to demonstrate to the Parole Board by the time of the expiry of their tariff periods that it was not longer necessary for the protection of the public for them to remain in detention.\\nThere was a breach of the Secretary of States public law duty to provide these facilities.\\nBut, as I noted in para 5, counsel for the prisoners accepted that they were unable to challenge the legality of the warrant which authorised their continued detention.\\nThat provides the context for the passage in the speech of Lord Brown of Eaton under Heywood in paras 36 and 37 on which Mr Tam relies, where he said: 36.\\nIt is one thing to say as indeed is now undisputed that the Secretary of State was in breach (even systemic breach) of his public law duty to provide such courses as would enable IPP prisoners to demonstrate their safety for release and, to some extent at least, course enabling them to reduce the risk they pose, duties inherent in the legislation (the legislations underlying premise as Laws LJ described it [2008] 1 All ER 138, paras 24, 50); quite another to say that such breach of duty results in detention being unlawful.\\nI respectfully agree with the Court of Appeal that it does not. 37.\\nThe remedy for such breach of public law duty indeed the only remedy, inadequate in certain respects it may be is declaratory relief condemning the Secretary of States failures and indicating that he is obliged to do more Past failures do not sound in\\ndamages\\nIn my own speech in Walker, para 6, I said that in terms of the statute the detention was lawful until the Parole board gave a direction for the prisoners release.\\nThe default position was that until the direction was given the protection of the public required that the prisoner should be confined.\\nI do not think that Lord Browns observations can be applied to the different statutory regime that we are concerned with it this case.\\nI agree with him that Walker is no more helpful to the respondents case than Roberts is to the appellant: para 104, below.\\nFor the same reason I do not think that the decision in Dunn v Parole Board [2008] EWCA Civ 374, [2009] 1 WLR 728, where the Court of Appeal applied the same approach where the Parole Board had failed to conduct a timely review and the appellant remained in detention as authorised by the statute, is of any assistance in this case.\\nDiscussion\\nI cannot find in these authorities anything that requires us to hold that the claim for damages for false imprisonment is untenable or which points conclusively in the other direction.\\nI would start therefore with principle that must lie at the heart of any discussion as to whether a persons detention can be justified.\\nThe liberty of the subject can be interfered with only upon grounds that the court will uphold as lawful: R v Governor of Brockhill Prison, Ex p Evans (No 2) [2001] 2 AC 19, 35; see also Tam Te Lam v Superintendent of Tai A Chau Detention Centre [1997] AC 97, per Lord Browne Wilkinson at p 111B.\\nIn Ex p Evans (No 2), p 42, Lord Hobhouse of Woodborough said: Imprisonment involves the infringement of a legally protected right and therefore must be justified.\\nIf it cannot be lawfully justified, it is no defence for the defendant to say that he believed that he could justify it.\\nWe are dealing in this case with the power of executive detention under the 1971 Act.\\nIt depends on the exercise of a discretion, not on a warrant for detention issued by any court.\\nThat is why the manner of its exercise was so carefully qualified by Woolf J in Hardial Singh.\\nThe power to detain must be exercised reasonably and in a manner which is not arbitrary.\\nIf it is not, the detention cannot be lawfully justified.\\nThe initial decision to detain will be held to be lawful if it is made under the authority of the Secretary of State pending the making of a deportation order.\\nBut it cannot be asserted, in the light of what was said in Hardial Singh, that the initial decision renders continued and indefinite detention lawful until the deportation order is made whatever the circumstances.\\nNor can it be said that it has that effect after the deportation order is made pending the persons removal from the United Kingdom when the person is being detained under paragraph 2(3).\\nThe authority that stems from the initial decision is not unqualified.\\nThe question then is what is to be made of the Secretary of States public law duty to give effect to his published policy.\\nIn my opinion the answer to that question will always be fact sensitive.\\nIn this case we are dealing with an executive act which interferes with personal liberty.\\nSo one must ask whether the published policy is sufficiently closely related to the authority to detain to provide a further qualification of the discretion that he has under the statute.\\nUnlike the 2001 Rules, chapter 38 of the manual is concerned with the lawfulness of the detention.\\nThat is made clear in the opening paragraphs: see para 18, above.\\nIt has been designed to give practical effect to the Hardial Singh principles to meet the requirement that, to be lawful, the measures taken must be transparent and not arbitrary.\\nIt contains a set of instructions with which officials are expected to comply: see Schedule 2 to the 1971 Act, para 1(3).\\nAs I see it, the principles and the instructions in the manual go hand in hand.\\nAs Munby J said in para 68, the reviews are fundamental to the propriety of continued detention.\\nThe instructions are the means by which, in accordance with his published policy, the Secretary of State gives effect to the principles.\\nThey are not only commendable; they are necessary.\\nThe relationship of the review to the exercise of the authority is very close.\\nThey too go hand in hand.\\nIf the system works as it should, authorisation for continued detention is to be found in the decision taken at each review.\\nReferences to the authority to detain in the forms that were issued in the appellants case illustrate this point.\\nForm IS 151F, which is headed Monthly Progress Report to Detainees, concludes at the top of page 3 of 3 with the words Authority to maintain detention given, on which the officers comments are invited and beneath which his decision is recorded.\\nThe discretion to continue detention must, of course, be exercised in accordance with the principles.\\nBut it must also be exercised in accordance with the policy stated in the manual.\\nThe timetable which paragraph 38.8 sets out is an essential part of the process.\\nThese are limitations on the way the discretion may be exercised.\\nFollowing the guidance that Nadarajah v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2004] INLR 139 provides (see paras 39 and 40, above), I would hold that if they are breached without good reason continued detention is unlawful.\\nIn principle it must follow that tortious remedies will be available, including the remedy of damages.\\nThere remains however the question of causation: what if the Secretary of State is able to show that, despite the failure to give effect to the policy, continued detention was nevertheless compatible with the Hardial Singh principles? Is it an answer for the Secretary of State to say that, as he could have authorised continued detention had lawful procedures been followed, no tort was committed? Is there room in such a situation for an award of damages?\\nThese questions are brought into sharp focus in this case.\\nMr Husain accepts that the Secretary of State would have been able to justify the need for the appellants detention under the Hardial Singh principles at all times had he been required to do so.\\nBut in Roberts v Chief Constable of the Cheshire Constabulary [1999] 1 WLR 662, 667, Clarke LJ said that it was nothing to the point to say that the detention would have been lawful if a review had been carried out or that there were grounds which would have justified detention.\\nThe statutory requirement with which he was dealing in that case existed in order to ensure that members of the public were not detained except in certain defined circumstances.\\nIn all other circumstances, he said, every member of the public is entitled to his liberty.\\nI would apply that reasoning to this case.\\nIt is true that the reviews were not required by the statute.\\nBut there was a public law duty to give effect to the provisions about reviews in the manual.\\nIf the reviews were not carried out unless for good reason, which is not suggested in this case continued detention was not authorised by the initial decision to detain.\\nIt is no defence for the Secretary of State to say that there were good grounds for detaining the appellant anyway.\\nUnless the authority to detain was renewed under the powers conferred by the statute he was entitled to his liberty.\\nThe decision in Lumba leads inevitably to this conclusion.\\nAs for the question of damages, the decision on this point in Lumba was that the appellants were entitled to no more than nominal damages as their detention was at all times justifiable.\\nBut this cannot be assumed to be so in every case, and in this case the facts have still to be established.\\nSo I would not foreclose entirely the possibility that the appellant in this case is entitled to more than a purely nominal award.\\nThe public law duty exists for the protection of everyone, from the most undeserving to the most vulnerable.\\nThe detention of children, those suffering from physical or mental illness and those who have been traumatised by torture are perhaps the most obvious examples.\\nParagraph 38.8 states that children are reviewed on a regular basis to ensure that the decision to detain is based on the current circumstances of the case and that detention remains appropriate.\\nThis sentence makes explicit in the case of children what must be taken to be the purpose of the reviews in all cases.\\nThe difference is that the system provides for more frequent reviews in the case of children.\\nIn any event, false imprisonment is a trespass against the person which is actionable without proof of special damage: Murray v Ministry of Defence [1988] 1 WLR 692, 701 702, per Lord Griffiths; Roberts v Chief Constable of the Cheshire Constabulary [1999] 1 WLR 662, 666 669, per Lord Clarke.\\nThere may well be issues as to quantum in cases of that kind.\\nAs Smith LJ said in Iqbal v Prison Officers Association [2009] EWCA Civ 1312, [2010] QB 732, para 83, an award of damages for false imprisonment is based on normal compensatory principles: see also Langley v Liverpool City Council [2005] EWCA Civ 1173, [2006] 1 WLR 375, para 70.\\nIt may be that the conclusion in this case will be that an award of nominal damages is all that is needed to recognise that the appellants fundamental rights have been breached.\\nBut that does not affect the issue of principle.\\nI would hold therefore that the appellant is entitled to the remedy he seeks at common law.\\nThere will, of course, have to be an inquiry as to the quantum of damages if the amount is not agreed.\\nArticle 5\\nThe appellants alternative claim is that he has an enforceable right to compensation under article 5(5) of the Convention.\\nHe maintains that his detention did not satisfy the requirements of article 5(1)(f).\\nIt was not lawful, and it was not in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law.\\nHe relies on what the Grand Chamber said in Saadi v United Kingdom (2008) 47 EHRR 17, para 74, and in A v United Kingdom (2009) 49 EHRR 29; Application No 3455/05, 19 February 2009, para 164 as to what was needed to avoid the detention being branded as arbitrary.\\nThe protections referred to in these passages are, as Mr Husain points out, redolent of the Hardial Singh principles.\\nIt is agreed on both sides that the article 5 claim adds nothing to the claim at common law if that claim succeeds: see R (I) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2003] INLR 196, per Simon Brown LJ at para 8; R (Munjaz) v Mersey Care NHS Trust [2004] 2 QB 395, per Hale LJ at para 70.\\nIndeed there are reasons for thinking that the Hardial Singh principles are in some respects more favourable to detainees than Strasbourg requires, as Lord Brown indicates: see para 94, below; Chahal v United Kingdom (1996) 23 EHRR 413, para 112; Saadi v United Kingdom, para 72.\\nSo, as I would hold that the appellant succeeds on his common law claim, I propose to say no more about this alternative, except to note that article 5(5) gives a right to compensation where there has been a contravention of any of the provisions of the article.\\nThis would have provided the appellant with a remedy if, although there was a breach of the public law duty to conduct reviews, he was not entitled to claim damages at common law for false imprisonment.\\nAs it is, for the reasons I have given, I consider that he is entitled to that remedy and at least to nominal damages.\\nConclusion\\nFor these reasons, and for those given by Lady Hale and Lord Kerr with which I am in full agreement, I would allow the appeal.\\nI would restore the declaration that was made by Munby J that the appellants detention by the Secretary of State was unlawful for the periods stated by him, except for a period of one month beginning on 6 December 2007 when the only defect in the decision to continue detention was that the review was carried out by an official of the wrong grade: see R (Lumba v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2011] 2 WLR 671, para 68 per Lord Dyson.\\nI would also restore his orders as to the assessment, if the parties are not agreed, of the quantum of damages.\\nLADY HALE\\nMr Shepherd Kambadzi may not be a very nice person.\\nHe is certainly not a very good person.\\nHe has overstayed his welcome in this country for many years.\\nHe has abused our hospitality by committing assaults and sexual assault.\\nIt is not surprising that the Home Secretary wishes to deport him.\\nBut in R (Roberts) v Parole Board [2005] UKHL 45, [2005] 2 AC 738, para 84, Lord Steyn quoted the well known remark of Justice Frankfurter in United States v Rabinowitz (1950) 339 US 56, p 69, that It is a fair summary of history to say that the safeguards of liberty have frequently been forged in controversies involving not very nice people.\\nLord Steyn continued: Even the most wicked of men are entitled to justice at the hands of the state.\\nAnd I doubt whether Mr Kambadzi is the most wicked of men.\\nHe had come to the end of the time he was due to serve as a result of his crimes.\\nHe may even have been expecting to be released from prison on 8 March 2006.\\nIf so, it must have come as a cruel shock when he was kept in prison (indeed for many months in the same prison where he had been serving his sentence), because the Home Secretary had decided to make a deportation order against him and at the same time to exercise the power to authorise his detention under paragraph 2(2) of Schedule 3 to the Immigration Act 1971.\\nThis gives the Secretary of State an apparently open ended power to authorise the detention of a person who has been served with a notice of intention to deport pending the making of the deportation order.\\nThe order was in fact made more than a year later, after which Mr Kambadzi was detained under paragraph 2(3) of the Schedule, which again gives an apparently open ended power to authorise detention pending his removal or departure from the United Kingdom.\\nNo court had ordered or authorised or approved this detention.\\nThe trial judge who sentenced Mr Kambadzi for his crimes had not even recommended it.\\nA Government official decided to lock him up, on the face of it until a Government official decided to take the next step.\\nBut no one suggests that paragraph 2 of Schedule 3 gives the Government an unlimited power to authorise a persons indefinite detention without trial.\\nEveryone knows that there are limits.\\nEveryone also knows that if those limits are exceeded, the detention becomes unlawful.\\nEveryone also knows that a person who is unlawfully detained is entitled, not only to be released, but to claim compensation for having been unlawfully detained.\\nThe person responsible for the unlawful detention is liable even if he acted in good faith and without any negligence: see R v Governor of Brockhill Prison, Ex p Evans (No 2) [2001] 2 AC 19 (compare the statutory protection given to those who detain mentally disordered or incapacitated people under the Mental Health Act 1983 or the Mental Capacity Act 2005: see s 139(1) and Schedule A1, para 3 respectively).\\nAll this is Hornbook law.\\nThe only question, therefore, is what the limits are to the Home Secretarys powers.\\nIn particular, are there procedural as well as substantive limits? The substantive limits were established as long ago as 1983, in the powerful extempore judgment of Woolf J in R v Governor of Durham Prison, Ex p Hardial Singh [1984] 1 WLR 704, and approved by the Privy Council in Tan Te Lam v Superintendent of the Tai A Chau Detention Centre [1997] AC 97.\\nThe detention has to be pending the deportation order or the removal, as the case may be, and cannot therefore be imposed for any other purpose.\\nIf it becomes clear that the purpose cannot be carried out, the detention becomes unlawful.\\nIn Tan Te Lam, above, the detention of these particular Vietnamese boat people became unlawful once it was clear that the Vietnamese Government did not regard them as Vietnamese nationals and would not have them back.\\nIt was also held in Hardial Singh that the Secretary of State cannot detain a person for longer than is reasonable in all the circumstances.\\nThis can depend upon the reasons for the delay.\\nThe Secretary of State has to exercise all reasonable expedition to ensure that the steps are taken which will be necessary to ensure the removal of the individual within a reasonable time: Hardial Singh, at p 706F.\\nIf the Secretary of State is dragging his feet, then the period may become unreasonable.\\nBut if the detainee is unjustifiably stringing things out, for example by launching an obviously bogus asylum claim, it will not.\\nIn this case, Munby J held that the Home Secretary did indeed intend to deport Mr Kambadzi and that this was still a possibility.\\nHe had been detained for a very long time (22 months by the time that Munby J decided the case in January 2008).\\nBut for most of that time he had been pursuing a claim for asylum, which was clearly bogus, through all possible appellate routes.\\nThereafter he could not be deported because the Home Secretary had temporarily suspended removals to Zimbabwe.\\nBut there remained some prospect of achieving this.\\nHence the detention was substantively justified in accordance with the Hardial Singh principles.\\nBut Munby J held that the detention had, for much of those 22 months, been unlawful because of the failure of the Secretary of States officials to conduct the regular reviews laid down in his own Operations Enforcement Manual.\\nNo one doubts that the failure to conduct these reviews was unlawful, and that the Secretary of State could have been obliged by judicial review proceedings to comply with his stated policy, unless he had a good reason not to do so in the individual case: see the Court of Appeals judgment in this case at [2009] EWCA Civ 1204, [2009] 1 WLR 1527, para 25.\\nThe issue is whether that unlawful failure has also rendered the detention unlawful.\\nThe Manual seemed to think that it did.\\nIt stated that the purpose of the reviews was to ensure that the detention continued to be justified: see para 38.3.4.\\nFurther than that, it declared, at para 38.1: To be lawful, detention must not only be based on one of the statutory powers and accord with the limitations implied by domestic and Strasbourg case law but must also accord with this stated policy.\\nThe Court of Appeal took the same view in Nadarajah v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2003] EWCA Civ 1768, [2004] INLR 139.\\nAt para 54, Lord Phillips stated that: Our domestic law comprehends both the provisions of Schedule 2 to the Immigration Act 1971 and the Secretary of States published policy, which, under principles of public law, he is obliged to follow.\\nThe failure to follow that published policy rendered the detentions unlawful in that case.\\nThe policy which was in question there related to the considerations that the Secretary of State would take into account in deciding to detain.\\nIt went further than the bare bones of the Hardial Singh principles.\\nNadarajah was a case principally brought under article 5 of the European Convention on Human Rights.\\nThe question, therefore, was whether the detention was lawful in the sense that it complied with the Convention standards of legality.\\nIt is not surprising that the Court held that, to be lawful, a decision to detain had to comply, not only with the statute, but also with the Secretary of States published policy.\\nBut it is also not surprising that the majority of this Court has now held, in R (Lumba and Mighty) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2011] UKSC 12; [2011] 2 WLR 671, that a failure to comply with the Secretary of States published policy may also render detention unlawful for the purpose of the tort of false imprisonment.\\nWhile accepting that not every failure to comply with a published policy will render the detention unlawful, I remain of the view that the breach of public law duty must be material to the decision to detain and not to some other aspect of the detention and it must be capable of affecting the result which is not the same as saying that the result would have been different had there been no breach (see the Lumba case, para 207).\\nThe question remains, however, whether a material breach of a public law duty to conduct regular reviews that is, a procedural obligation has the same consequence as a material breach of a public law duty to detain only if certain criteria are fulfilled.\\nFor the sake of the argument before this Court, we have to assume that the case falls into the former category breach of a procedural obligation even though the co incidence of timing and the evidence of the secret policy which emerged in Lumba might suggest that the real reason why the reviews were not conducted as required by the policy was that they would be a waste of time all these people were going to be detained under the new and secret criteria in any event.\\nBut might there be a distinction between the substantive limitations on the power to detain and the procedural requirements for exercising it?\\nSometimes a statute puts the effect of a failure to follow procedural requirements beyond doubt.\\nThe Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, section 34(1), states that A person . shall not be kept in police detention except in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Act; those provisions require regular reviews; failure to conduct those reviews on time renders detention beyond the time when they should have been conducted unlawful: see Roberts v Chief Constable of the Cheshire Constabulary [1999] 1 WLR 662, CA.\\nSometimes a statute does not say in so many words that failing to comply with one of its procedural requirements will render the resulting detention unlawful, but the courts will construe the statute to mean that it does.\\nAn example is the prohibition in the Mental Health Act 1983, section 11(4)(a), of making an application for compulsory admission to hospital if the patients nearest relative objects: Re S C (Mental Patient: Habeas Corpus) [1996] QB 599, CA.\\nIn these cases, it is irrelevant that the person concerned could have been lawfully detained had the correct procedures been followed.\\nSometimes, however, the court will conclude that the lawfulness of detention does not depend upon the fulfilment of a particular statutory requirement.\\nFor example, in R (D) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2006] EWHC 980 (Admin), it was common ground that failing to comply with the requirement in the (Immigration) Detention Centre Rules 2001 SI 2001/238 that immigration detainees be given a medical examination within 24 hours of arrival did not render the detention unlawful unless the detainees could show that it would have led to their earlier release.\\nIn short, there are some procedural requirements, failure to comply with which renders the detention unlawful irrespective of whether or not the substantive grounds for detention exist, and some procedural requirements, failure to follow which does not have this effect.\\nIf the requirement is laid down in legislation, it will be a matter of statutory construction into which category it falls.\\nA clear distinction can be drawn between a requirement which goes to whether or not a person is detained and a requirement which goes to the conditions under which a person is detained.\\nIf the grounds exist for detaining a person in a mental hospital, for example, and the procedures have been properly followed, it is not unlawful to detain him in conditions of greater security than are in fact required by the nature and degree of his mental disorder.\\nThe same analysis applies to requirements which are imposed, not by statute, but by the common law.\\nThere are some procedural requirements which go to the legality of the detention itself and some which do not.\\nThe common law imposed a requirement that an arrested person be told, at the time, the real reason why he was being arrested.\\nIt did so for the very good reason that the arrested person had to know whether or not he was entitled to resist arrest.\\nMr Leachinsky was told that he was being arrested under the Liverpool Corporation Act 1921, but this Act gave the police officers no power to arrest him without a warrant.\\nThey did have power to arrest him on reasonable suspicion of having committed a felony.\\nBut, as they had not told him this, his detention was unlawful and he was entitled to damages for false imprisonment: see Christie v Leachinsky [1947] AC 573.\\nAs Lord Simonds put it, at p 592, if a man is to be deprived of his freedom he is entitled to know the reason why.\\nIt is not statute, but the common law, indeed the rule of law itself, which imposes upon the Secretary of State the duty to comply with his own stated policy, unless he has a good reason to depart from it in the particular case at the particular time.\\nSome parts of the policy in question are not directly concerned with the justification and procedure for the detention and have more to do with its quality or conditions.\\nBut the whole point of the regular reviews is to ensure that the detention is lawful.\\nThat is not surprising.\\nIt was held in Tan Te Lam, above, that the substantive limits on the power to detain were jurisdictional facts, so the Secretary of State has to be in a position to prove these if need be.\\nHe will not be able to do so unless he has kept the case under review.\\nHe himself has decided how often this needs to be done.\\nUnless and until he changes his mind, the detainees are entitled to hold him to that.\\nJust as Mr Leachinskys detention was unlawful even though there were in fact good grounds for arresting him, the detainees detention is unlawful during the periods when it has not been reviewed in accordance with the policy, irrespective of whether or not the review would have led to their release.\\nIn my view, Munby J was right to hold that the reviews were fundamental to the propriety of the continuing detention and a necessary prerequisite to the continuing legality of the detention: see [2008] EWHC 98 (Admin), para 68.\\nIt follows also, from the decision in Lumba, that the fact if it be a fact that had the requisite reviews been held, the decision would have been the same makes no difference.\\nHowever, the result of any review, had it been held, cannot be irrelevant to the quantum of damages to which the detainee may be entitled.\\nFalse imprisonment is a trespass to the person and therefore actionable per se, without proof of loss or damage.\\nBut that does not affect the principle that the defendant is only liable to pay substantial damages for the loss and damage which his wrongful act has caused.\\nThe amount of compensation to which a person is entitled must be affected by whether he would have suffered the loss and damage had things been done as they should have been done.\\nA differently constituted majority in Lumba has now clearly rejected the view, taken by some members of the Court, that deliberate breaches of constitutional rights might attract a conventional sum in vindicatory damages even if the officials conduct were not so egregious as to attract exemplary or punitive damages.\\nThat view has, of course, to be respected.\\nI have reached these conclusions without reference to the Strasbourg case law under article 5 of the European Convention on Human Rights.\\nI did initially think that article 5 might supply the answer to what, on any view, is not an easy question.\\nArticle 5 lays down an exhaustive list of the circumstances in which a person may be deprived of his liberty.\\nThese include, in article 5(1)(f), the lawful arrest or detention of a person against whom action is being taken with a view to deportation or extradition.\\nThe requirement of lawfulness is not limited to complying with the substantive and procedural provisions of the domestic law.\\nThe Convention itself imports extra requirements in order to ensure that the detention is not arbitrary.\\nSome of these are procedural.\\nThus the detention of persons of unsound mind under article 5(1)(e), even if formally authorised, must be regularly reviewed in order to ensure that the criteria for detention still exist: see X v United Kingdom (1982) 4 EHRR 118.\\nA principle of domestic law which allows people to be de facto detained without any formality at all contravenes article 5(1)(e) (as well as article 5(4)) even though the criteria for detention do exist: see HL v United Kingdom (2005) 40 EHRR 761.\\nThe Strasbourg court has not yet (so far as we are aware) addressed the procedural protection which may be required in order to prevent detention by the executive under article 5(1)(f) becoming arbitrary.\\nThe notion of arbitrariness for the purpose of article 5(1)(f) is, however, different from the notion of arbitrariness for the purpose of article 5(1)(b), (d) and (e).\\nIt does not require that the detention be necessary in order to achieve the stated aim: see Chahal v United Kingdom (1997) 23 EHRR 413; Saadi v United Kingdom (2008) 47 EHRR 427.\\nBut in Chahal, the Court did endorse the Hardial Singh principles, which incorporate a reasonable time limit on the detention.\\nIt is not impossible, therefore, that the Court would also impose a requirement for regular reviews.\\nBut it cannot be assumed that it would do so, or that it would expect these to be as rigorous as those which the Secretary of State has imposed upon himself.\\nThus, while the article 5 jurisprudence does not detract from the conclusions reached on domestic law, it does not add anything to them.\\nFor those reasons, I would allow the appeal and make the order proposed by Lord Hope, although I would not hold out much hope that Mr Kambadzi will be entitled to more than a nominal sum in damages.\\nMy reasons for reaching this conclusion are, I believe, no different from those of Lord Hope and Lord Kerr.\\nBut because the Court is so narrowly divided, I thought it necessary to reason the matter through for myself.\\nThe decision in Lumba has confirmed and strengthened me in these conclusions, although I acknowledge that, as this case was presented to us, the departure from published departmental policy was of a different kind from the departure in that case.\\nNevertheless, it was so obvious and so persistent and so directly related to the decision to continue to detain that it was clearly material in the Lumba sense.\\nWhether in reality it was a Lumba case is not for this Court to decide.\\nLORD KERR\\nI agree with Lord Hope that this appeal should be allowed for the reasons that he has given.\\nI also agree that the anonymity order should be set aside.\\nAs Lord Hope has said, it may be safely assumed that an asylum seeker will be alive to the risks that disclosure of his identity will entail and his stance on the question of anonymity, especially if he expresses no desire that it be maintained, will be of importance in striking the balance between avoiding unnecessary risks to the asylum seekers safety and the principle of open justice.\\nThe critical question in this appeal is whether compliance with the duty to review underpins the legality of the detention.\\nIt is accepted that there is a duty to review.\\nIt is further accepted that this duty had not been complied with.\\nDoes that make the detention unlawful? The respondent says that it does not, arguing that the situation encountered here is not comparable to that which demands compliance with a statutory obligation on which the condition of lawfulness of the detention depends.\\nIt is suggested that a failure to observe a public law duty should not render unlawful a hitherto lawful detention because there can be no sufficient nexus between such a failure and the lawfulness of the detention.\\nOne can acknowledge the initial appeal of the respondents argument.\\nIf a statute prescribes certain conditions that must be met in order that a person may be lawfully held in detention, where one of those conditions remains unfulfilled, the detention may be regarded as automatically unlawful.\\nBy contrast, the failure to fulfil a duty owed at public law will not necessarily render invalid a detention made on foot of a valid authorisation.\\nThe essential question must be whether there is an adequate connection between compliance with the duty and the lawfulness of the detention.\\nThe respondents argument proceeds on the premise that there can never be such a close link.\\nThe appellants case is that it depends on the circumstances some public law duties are so closely linked to the continued legality of the detention that a failure to comply with them transforms it from a condition of lawfulness to one which is unlawful.\\nThe case can be approached in a relatively simplistic way.\\nThe appellant has a legal entitlement to have the justification for his detention reviewed.\\nThis is not disputed.\\nLikewise it is not challenged that where there has been a violation of that right, the appellant must have a remedy.\\nIs that remedy to be confined to a declaration and/or an injunction? And if he is entitled to these forms of relief, why should he not be entitled to maintain an action for damages for false imprisonment? Given that what is at stake is the appellants liberty; that there is a presumption in favour of his release; that scrupulous adherence to the review standards is clearly contemplated in the language of the policy document; and that, plainly, these are considered to be vital safeguards of the detainees interests, I can discern no reason in principle to restrict the availability of all remedies that the law will conventionally afford for unlawful detention.\\nOn the contrary, it appears to me that access to the full panoply of such remedies is required in order that those fundamental interests are afforded proper protection.\\nAnother way of approaching the questions that arise on the appeal is to ask whether the initial authority to detain could be regarded as comprehensive of the issues which are germane to the continued lawfulness of detention.\\nQuite clearly, detention which is lawful initially can be transformed to a condition of illegality see R v Governor of Durham Prison Ex p Hardial Singh [1984] 1 WLR 704.\\nIn his argument to this court on behalf of the Secretary of State, Mr Tam QC has asserted that where the detention is initially lawful, it cannot become unlawful, absent an undermining of the initial authority to detain.\\nBut there was no undermining of the initial authority in that sense in Hardial Singh yet the initially lawful detention became unlawful.\\nThat transformation occurred by a means other than by operation of an express statutory pre condition or by the extinction of the initial authority to detain.\\nIn Hardial Singh it was held that there were implicit limitations on the statutory power to continue to detain.\\nIf, for instance, the original purpose of detention viz to deport became incapable of fulfilment, the detainee could no longer be lawfully held.\\nWhy should implicit limitations in the form of an effective review of the continuing justification for detention not be recognised in the present case? Where someone is detained beyond the immediate post detention period, there may be two aspects to the question whether his detention is lawful.\\nFirst there must be an initial valid authorisation; secondly, there must be compliance with such public law duties as touch directly on the question of whether he should continue to be detained.\\nThat proposition can perhaps be best exemplified in the context of a review of the justification of the reasons for continued detention by considering the purpose of that review.\\nOne starts with the unexceptionable proposition that it would be indisputably unlawful to hold someone in detention if there was no justification for it.\\nSince, self evidently, an original justification for detention may prove, in light of events and circumstances that occur subsequently, to no longer obtain, periodic review of the justification for continued detention is required.\\nThe purpose of the review is to determine whether there are still good grounds to continue to hold the person in detention.\\nIf the review discloses that there are no such grounds, continued detention is unquestionably illegal.\\nA person detained after it had been shown that there was no good reason for his continued detention would undoubtedly have the right to claim compensation for false imprisonment.\\nAs Lord Hope has said, support for the proposition that a departure from published policy as to detention will render it unlawful is to be found in R (Nadarajah) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2004] INLR 139.\\nLord Brown has sought to distinguish that case from the present appeal on the basis that in Nadarajah the grounds on which the power of executive detention could be exercised had been narrowed but that no such narrowing of powers occurred here.\\nBut if the published policy in Nadarajah narrowed the grounds on which someone could be lawfully detained, why should the same consequence not accrue in the present case? In Nadarajah the stated policy was to release those whose removal was not imminent.\\nHere it is to the effect that persons will only be detained if there is continuing justification for it, as verified by a prescribed system of review.\\nLord Brown suggests that in Nadarajah the detainee was entitled to release and in the present case that the appellant was entitled 'merely' to be reviewed for release.\\nI respectfully disagree that such a distinction can be drawn.\\nThe essence of the appellant's entitlement was that he would be released unless continued justification for his detention existed.\\nThe review was the means by which the existence of the justification was to be established.\\nIt is not comprehensive of the detainee's entitlement.\\nAs in Nadarajah the appellant in the present case is entitled to be released in accordance with the terms of the relevant policy, if justification for his continued detention no longer obtains.\\nWhat if no review takes place? If it is illegal to hold a person in detention where it has been established that there are no good grounds for doing so, can it be lawful to hold someone without examining whether such grounds continue to exist? In my view it cannot.\\nSince it has been recognised that, in cases such as the appellants, periodic review is necessary in order to vouch the continued justification for detention, where that review does not take place, the detention can no longer be considered justified.\\nThe justification for continued detention cannot be said to exist and, absent such justification, the detention is unlawful.\\nLikewise, in my opinion, where the review does take place but does not partake of the quality or character required to justify the continuance of detention, it becomes unlawful and gives rise to a right to claim false imprisonment.\\nI believe that Munby J was right in his characterisation of the system of review as being integral to the lawfulness of the detention (para 68 of his judgment).\\nIt was not only so stated in the policy document, this concept pervades the entire approach of government to this type of detention.\\nI accept, of course, that the Executive cannot make law and that the policy document should not be construed as a statute but it is not irrelevant that the Home Secretary made an unequivocal statement that failure to comply with the policy would be a breach of the law.\\nThis surely provides the foundation for a finding that the requirement of review is intimately connected to the continuing lawfulness of the detention and that it therefore constitutes an implicit limitation on the statutory power to detain.\\nThe majority in R (Lumba and Mighty) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2011] UKSC 12; [2011] 2 WLR 671, has held that causation is not a necessary ingredient for liability.\\nIn that case the argument on behalf of the detained persons was put in this way: a public law error that bears directly on the decision to detain will mean that the authority for detention is ultra vires and unlawful, and will sound in false imprisonment.\\nThat argument was accepted by the majority of the court in Lumba.\\nThe public law error in the present case bore directly on the decision to detain in that it was made without the necessary review of the justification for detention.\\nAs the majority in Lumba also held, however, causation is relevant to the question of the recoverability of damages.\\nFor the reasons that I gave in my judgment in that case, I consider that if it can be shown that the claimant would not have been released if a proper review had been carried out, this must have an impact on the quantum of compensation and that nominal damages only will be recoverable.\\nLORD BROWN (with whom Lord Rodger agrees)\\nDoes a failure to comply with a published policy periodically to review the exercise of a statutory power of executive detention constitute not merely the breach of a public law duty but in addition the tort of false imprisonment? Does it, in other words, undermine the lawfulness of continuing detention? That essentially is the issue before the Court on this appeal.\\nLord Hopes judgment contains a very full account of the facts, the arguments and the authorities relevant to this appeal so that my own judgment can be correspondingly short.\\nThe Immigration Act 1971, as amended, (the 1971 Act) provides (by paragraphs 2(2) and (3) of Schedule 3) that, in a case like this, once notice of intention to deport has been given, the Secretary of State may detain the person pending the making of the deportation order (paragraph 2(2)) and, once the deportation order has been made, the detainee shall continue to be detained [pending his removal or departure] unless he is released on bail or the Secretary of State directs otherwise (paragraph 2(3)).\\nOne suspects that when these provisions were enacted nearly 40 years ago Parliament envisaged the deportation process taking place within a comparatively short timescale, perhaps months at most.\\nAs it is, however, the process regularly stretches to years and not infrequently the position arises where, for one reason or another, it proves impossible for a considerable time to deport anyone to a particular country because of conditions there.\\nIn the past this has been true at various times of Somalia, of Afghanistan, of Iraq, and of Kosovo.\\nSince 2005 it has also been true of Zimbabwe which is why this appellant, although given notice of an intention to deport him on 8 March 2006, and made subject to a deportation order on 24 August 2007, remains in this country to this day.\\nMore particularly, this is the background to his detention under Schedule 3 to the 1971 Act (following completion of a prison sentence) from 8 March 2006 to 13 June 2008 when, after 27 months of Schedule 3 detention, he was finally released on bail.\\nThat the Secretary of States power to detain people under paragraph 2 of Schedule 3 (the paragraph 2 power as for convenience I shall call it) is not unlimited is plain and undisputed.\\nThis was first established by Woolf J in R v Governor of Durham Prison Ex p Hardial Singh [1984] 1 WLR 704, approved by the Privy Council in Tan Te Lam v Superintendent of Tai A Chau Detention Centre [1997] AC 97 and subsequently distilled by Dyson LJ in R (I) v Secretary of State for the Home Department) [2003] INLR 196, para 46 into four propositions (which, again for convenience, I shall call the Hardial Singh principles), as follows: (i) The Secretary of State must intend to deport the person and can only use the power to detain for that purpose. (ii) The deportee may only be detained for a period that is reasonable in all the circumstances. (iii) If, before the expiry of the reasonable period, it becomes apparent that the Secretary of State will not be able to effect deportation within that reasonable period, he should not seek to exercise the power of detention. (iv) The Secretary of State should act with reasonable diligence and expedition to effect removal.\\nAlthough suggested by the appellant to be broadly similar to the protections implied by the ECtHR into article 5(1)(f) of the Convention to ensure proportionality and guard against arbitrariness, to my mind the Hardial Singh principles, certainly as applied in a succession of later cases, are in fact more favourable to detainees than Strasbourg requires.\\nIn particular Strasbourg has consistently stated that there is no requirement that the detention be reasonably considered necessary, for example to prevent the person concerned from committing an offence or fleeing (para 72 of the Grand Chambers judgment in Saadi v UK (2008) 47 EHRR 427, following Chahal v UK (1996) 23 EHRR 413, para 112).\\nDomestic case law, by contrast, holds that with regard to the second Hardial Singh principle the deportee may only be detained for a period that is reasonable in all circumstances [t]he likelihood or otherwise of the detainee absconding and/or re offending [is] an obviously relevant circumstance (my judgment in I at para 29, echoed by Dyson LJ at paras 48 and 49).\\nI may note at this point that, notwithstanding that the full width of the Hardial Singh principles was clearly recognised by Munby J in the present case (paras 79 120), his conclusion was that none of them had been breached at any time, a conclusion unchallenged in the Court of Appeal.\\nIt follows that not merely was the appellant in a formal sense a person liable to be detained under the third Schedule (in the same way that the unsuccessful appellant in R (Khadir) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2006] 1 AC 207 was held liable to detention and thus eligible for temporary admission under the second Schedule even though it might well have been unreasonable and in breach of the Hardial Singh principles actually to have detained him); here the appellant was liable to be detained in the fuller sense that throughout the period of his detention it would have been a lawful and reasonable exercise of the paragraph 2 power actually to detain him.\\nOn what basis, then, is it said that the appellants detention was unlawful so as to give rise to a claim for damages for false imprisonment? The argument revolves around the Secretary of States published policy: chapter 38 of the Departments Operations Enforcement Manual (the OEM) under the heading Detention and Temporary Release.\\nThe policy (at 38.3) includes a presumption in favour of temporary admission or temporary release, provides that [t]here must be strong grounds for believing that a person will not comply with conditions of temporary admission or temporary release for detention to be justified and that [a]ll reasonable alternatives to detention must be considered before detention is authorised, and dictates that [o]nce detention has been authorised, it must be kept under close review to ensure that it continues to be justified.\\nParagraph 38.8 then specifies how both the initial detention and any continued detention thereafter are to be authorised and kept under review, expressly providing both for the frequency and for the level of seniority of the reviews required.\\nIn the event, as Munby J recorded (para 48), although entitled (by the date of the first instance hearing) to no fewer than 22 monthly reviews of the lawfulness of his detention, the appellant had had the benefit of only ten reviews, of which only six were conducted by officials of the requisite seniority, and of those six, two had had to be disavowed as fatally flawed.\\nParagraph 38.1 of the policy, headed General, states: To be lawful, detention must not only be based on one of the statutory powers and accord with the limitations implied by domestic and Strasbourg case law but must also accord with this stated policy.\\nIn a sense the question now before us is quite simply: is that statement accurate? Munby J in effect held that it was, not only as to the substantive requirements to justify continuing detention but as to the review requirements also.\\nAt para 68 of his judgment, having referred to rule 9(1) of the Detention Centre Rules (which, like Lord Hope, I think to be of only peripheral relevance) he continued: [I]ntegral to the policy laid down by the Secretary of State in paragraph 38.8 of the Operations Enforcement Manual, is the principle that someone is not to be detained beyond a certain period without there being a review undertaken at regular intervals and moreover, as required by the Secretary of States policy, a review undertaken at increasingly high levels of seniority within the Home Office as the period of detention grows longer.\\nThose reviews are fundamental to the propriety of the continuing detention, they are required in order to ensure that the continuing detention can still be justified in the light of current, and perhaps changed, circumstances, and they are, in my judgment, a necessary prerequisite to the continuing legality of the detention.\\nThat paragraph identifies the critical question: is the holding of the reviews required by the OEM a necessary prerequisite to the continuing legality of the detention? In addressing this question it is convenient first to distinguish the present case from certain other authorities strongly relied upon by the respective parties.\\nThe appellant (supported by the Intervener) seeks to pray in aid the Court of Appeals decision in Roberts v Chief Constable of the Cheshire Constabulary [1999] 1 WLR 662.\\nThe case turned on the proper construction of Part IV of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (the Part containing each of the sections to which I now refer).\\nThe detainee, following arrest, was initially kept in police detention pursuant to section 37.\\nSection 40(1) provided that: Reviews of the detention of each person in police detention in connection with the investigation of an offence shall be carried out periodically in accordance with the following provisions of this section.\\nSection 40(3)(a) provided that the first review shall be not later than six hours after the detention was first authorised.\\nCentral to the decision that, no such review within six hours having taken place, the detainees continued detention (until the point two hours, twenty minutes later when his detention was reviewed) had been unlawful (notwithstanding that had he been reviewed at the six hour point he clearly would still have been detained), was section 34(1) which provided that: A person arrested for an offence shall not be kept in police detention except in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Act.\\nMunby J appears to have thought Roberts strongly supportive of the appellants case.\\nLaws LJ, giving the leading judgment in the Court of Appeal, thought otherwise.\\nAs he pointed out ([2009] 1 WLR 1527, para 25): [T]he requirement of periodic review, on the proper construction of the statute, had to be satisfied as a condition precedent to the legality of the suspects detention.\\nIt was made so by the express terms of section 34(1).\\nBut there is no analogue to section 34(1) of PACE to be found in paragraph 2(2) of Schedule 3 to the Immigration Act 1971.\\nThere is no reference in the sub paragraph, express or implied, to the Rules or the manual or to any Rules that might be made under powers in the Immigration Act or to any manual, or instructions, that might be issued by the Secretary of State.\\nI cannot see how compliance with the letter of the Rules or manual could be said to be a sine qua non of a lawful exercise of the power to detain unless paragraph 2(2) (or other main legislation) made it so.\\nBut it does not.\\nI agree with Laws LJ that Roberts provides little if any assistance to the appellant here.\\nThe respondent for his part seeks to rely on R (Walker) v Secretary of State for Justice (Parole Board intervening) [2010] 1 AC 553 in support of his argument that a failure in the review process does not undermine the legality of (the unreviewed) continuing detention.\\nWalker was concerned with a number of appeals by IPP prisoners justifiably complaining of the Secretary of States systemic failures to provide the necessary resources and systems to enable such prisoners to demonstrate to the Parole Board that they could safely be released.\\nThe Divisional Court held in one of the cases, R (Wells) Parole Board [2008] 1 All ER 138, para 47: To the extent that the prisoner remains incarcerated after tariff expiry without any current and effective assessment of the danger he does or does not pose, his detention cannot in reason be justified.\\nIt is therefore unlawful.\\nThe Court of Appeal and the House of Lords disagreed.\\nAs I put it (at paras 36 37): It is one thing to say as, indeed, is now undisputed that the Secretary of State was in breach (even systemic breach) of his public law duty to provide such courses as would enable IPP prisoners to demonstrate their safety for release and, to some extent at least, courses enabling them to reduce the risk they pose, duties inherent in the legislation (the legislations underlying premise [as it was described in the court below]); quite another to say that such breach of duty results in detention being unlawful.\\nI respectfully agree with the Court of Appeal that it does not.\\nThe remedy for such breach of public law duty indeed the only remedy, inadequate though in certain respects it may be is declaratory relief condemning the Secretary of States failures and indicating that he is obliged to do more.\\nBy the same token, submits Mr Tam QC, the undisputed (and here too systemic) breaches of the Secretary of States public law duty to review, consistently with his published policy, the justifiability of the appellants (and doubtless very many other detainees) continuing detention, although (as in Walker) deeply to be regretted and strongly to be condemned, does not result in the unreviewed detention being unlawful.\\nTo my mind, however, Walker is no more helpful to the respondents case than Roberts is to the appellants.\\nAgain, as in Walker, the primary legislation made the position clear: IPP prisoners were expressly made subject to the statutory requirement (under section 28 of the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997) that they were not to be released until the Parole Board was satisfied that their continuing confinement was no longer necessary for the protection of the public.\\nIn the same way that Schedule 3 to the 1971 Act contains no analogue to section 34(1) of PACE, so too it contains no analogue to section 28 of the 1997 Act.\\nLaws LJ below identified (at para 21) the essential question here to be: What is the reach [of the paragraph 2 power] and characterised it as a question of statutory construction.\\nAt paragraph 35 he summarised his conclusions upon the question as follows: (i) Compliance with the Rules and manual as such is not a condition precedent to a lawful detention pursuant to paragraph 2(2).\\nStatute does not make it so (contrast section 34(1) of PACE, and the Roberts case [1999] 1 WLR 662).\\nNor does the common law, or the law of the Convention. (ii) Avoidance of the vice of arbitrary detention by use of the power conferred by paragraph 2(2) requires that in every case the Hardial Singh principles should be complied with. (iii) It is elementary that the power exercised, being an act of the executive, is subject to the control of the courts, principally by way of judicial review.\\nSo much is also required by Convention article 5(4).\\nThe focus of judicial supervision in the particular context is upon the vindication of the Hardial Singh principles. (iv) In the event of a legal challenge to any particular case the Secretary of State must be in a position to demonstrate by evidence that those principles have been and are being fulfilled.\\nHowever the law does not prescribe the form of such evidence.\\nCompliance with the Rules and the manual would be an effective and practical means of doing so.\\nIt is anyway the Secretary of States duty so to comply.\\nIt is firmly to be expected that hereafter that will be conscientiously done.\\nMr Raza Husains attack upon that paragraph centres upon the proposition that, following the initial exercise of the paragraph 2 power, the Secretary of State has a continuing discretion whether to maintain the detention and is under a duty to exercise that discretion regularly in accordance with the published policy.\\nSo much Mr Tam accepts and, indeed, he further accepts that every failure to review a detention by the specified time or by the specified level of decision maker constitutes a breach of the Secretary of States public law duty.\\nOf course, as Mr Husain recognises, not all breaches of public law duties arising in the context of detention would render its continuation unlawful see, for example, Cullen v Chief Constable of the Royal Ulster Constabulary [2003] 1 WLR 1763.\\nThe key question, he submits, is whether the breach is sufficiently closely linked to the detention decision.\\nHere, he contends, it plainly was.\\nThe authority (Roberts aside) upon which Mr Husain principally relies is the decision of the Court of Appeal in R (Nadarajah) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2004] INLR 139 (a report dealing also with Amirthanathans appeal I shall call them respectively N and A).\\nThat case too concerned the Secretary of States detention policy under chapter 38 of the OEM but not, as here, the review provisions rather the statement that one of the reasons for detaining an asylum seeker is that his removal from the UK is imminent.\\nWhat was not part of the published policy and so was not publicly known was the Departments further policy, when considering the imminence of removal, to disregard information from those acting for asylum seekers that proceedings were about to be instituted, however credible that information might be.\\nNs solicitors had given notice of his intention to seek judicial review of the Secretary of States decision to certify his case as manifestly unfounded.\\nAs solicitors similarly had notified his intention to exercise his right of appeal against the Secretary of States rejection of his Human Rights Act claim to remain.\\nThe detentions of both on the ground that their removal was imminent were held unlawful.\\nIt was, said the Court of Appeal (at para 68), at odds with [the Secretary of States] policy, as made public.\\nAdditionally, in As case, it was clear that he had in fact been kept detained so as to facilitate the obtaining of the documentation needed for his removal.\\nThis too was at odds with the Secretary of States policy, as made public (para 72).\\nI confess that for a time I was persuaded by the appellants argument and thought it supported by the authority of Nadarajah.\\nIn the end, however, I have reached the contrary view.\\nNadarajah now seems to me clearly distinguishable.\\nNot because, as the Court of Appeal noted in that case at para 69, had Ns solicitor been aware of the Secretary of States unpublished policy she would have instituted judicial review proceedings earlier, so that the departure from the published policy was in fact causative of Ns continued detention.\\nRather Nadarajah is distinguishable because it is one thing, as there, to adopt a published policy which in substance narrows the grounds on which an executive power of detention is exercisable (the stated policy there being to release those whose removal was not imminent); quite another, as here, to have a policy and programme for review which dictates only the procedure whereby detention will regularly be reviewed.\\nIn the former case, under the published policy the detainee was entitled to release; in the latter case, he was not he was entitled merely to be reviewed for release.\\nNaturally, upon the intended reviews, the detainee would be released if, as a matter of substance, his continuing detention were found no longer justifiable according to the published policy.\\nThe difference, however, seems to me crucial.\\nIn the one case a breach of policy renders continuing detention unlawful.\\nIn the other it does not.\\nLady Hale, at para 72 of her judgment, suggests an analogy between the present case and Christie v Leachinsky [1947] AC 573 which established the common law requirement that an arrested person be told, at the time, the reason for his arrest.\\nFor my part I find the suggestion unpersuasive.\\nAs Lady Hale herself observes, the requirement was imposed for the very good reason that the arrested person had to know whether or not he was entitled to resist arrest.\\nLord Simonds put it thus (p591): it is the corollary of the right of every citizen to be thus free from arrest [unless, that is, someone has the right to arrest him] that he should be entitled to resist arrest unless that arrest is lawful.\\nHow can these rights be reconciled with the proposition that he may be arrested without knowing why he is arrested? and a little later (p.592): . the subject is entitled to know why he is deprived of his freedom, if only in order that he may, without a moments delay, take such steps as will enable him to regain it.\\nNo such consideration arises or could arise in the present content.\\nTheir Lordships in Christie v Leachinsky would, I think, be astonished at the suggestion that any failure to give effect to a self imposed requirement for periodic review of the continuing detention of those awaiting deportation similarly renders that detention unlawful.\\nI fear that they would be scarcely less surprised by the further suggestion (at para 77 of Lady Hales judgment) that, assuming such detention to be unlawful, it is to be compensated by no more than a nominal sum in damages.\\nIndeed it seems to me that that very suggestion illustrates the ineptness of the proposed analogy between the two cases in the first place.\\nThe majoritys proposed solution to this case would quite simply devalue the whole concept of false imprisonment.\\nNothing that I have said should be taken to depreciate the desirability and importance of reviews under chapter 38 nor to excuse the Departments lamentable failures to conduct them, certainly in the appellants case and very probably in a host of others.\\nAs the courts below rightly observed, these matters go to the liberty of the subject and the picture which emerges is deeply disturbing, indeed profoundly shocking (Munby J, para 137).\\nOne obvious consequence of such serial failures is that it creates a substantially greater risk of detainees bringing successful proceedings for breach of the Hardial Singh principles (or, indeed, assuming they are still more favourable to detainees, the Secretary of States published policy statements going to the substantive criteria for release, as in Nadarajah itself) principles and statements to which the reviews are intended and likely to give effect.\\nAnd, of course, as the Hardial Singh line of authority (and, indeed, Nadarajah) clearly establishes, a successful claim on these grounds carries with it a right to damages for false imprisonment, a right to damages, moreover, which, unlike that arising upon a failure to review such as envisaged by the majority (and, indeed, such as arose in Roberts see p669H), would naturally be untroubled by any question of causation.\\nI recognise, of course, that, on this approach, it is only in cases where the detainee can show that he should have been released that the respondent will be required to pay, financially, for failures in the review process.\\nWhere, as here, all that can be shown is a series of public law breaches failures to comply with his own published policy as to reviews the only remedy, as in Walker, is by way of declaratory relief.\\nUnsatisfactory though in one way this is, to treat a failure in the review process (perhaps merely a review held a day late or by someone of insufficient seniority and perhaps in respect of an obviously dangerous detainee) as of itself giving rise (as in Roberts) to a claim for false imprisonment would to my mind be unsatisfactory too.\\nThere may well be altogether too many people (above all children and other likewise vulnerable people) locked up awaiting deportation.\\nPlainly a wise Secretary of State would instigate and operate a practicable and robust system for minimising the use made of the paragraph 2 power.\\nAs it is, like any other public body failing to comply with their published policy, he commits a breach of his public law duty, always a regrettable state of affairs.\\nThat said, however, a detainee, once properly detained, in my opinion remains lawfully imprisoned unless and until released on bail or by the Secretary of States direction or he establishes an entitlement to release pursuant to the Hardial Singh principles or other substantive policy statements governing how the Secretary of State will exercise his paragraph 2 power.\\nThis appellant could establish no such entitlement.\\nIn my judgment he remained lawfully imprisoned until he was bailed.\\nIt will be noted that I have not hitherto referred to article 5(1)(f) of the Convention save only to observe (at para 94) that domestic law is in fact more favourable to detainees awaiting deportation than Strasbourg requires.\\nSince it now appears that this is to be a minority judgment, I need say no more than that there is nothing in the existing Strasbourg jurisprudence which would warrant a conclusion that a failure to give effect to the Secretary of States self imposed requirement for detention reviews would result in unlawful detention under the Convention irrespective of whether it constitutes false imprisonment under the common law. (I do not think I am in disagreement with the majority as to this see, for example, para 76 of Lady Hales judgment.) Nor, of course, is there any question here of a breach of article 5(4) of the Convention: the requirements of that provision are amply satisfied by the detainees right to seek bail or, indeed, judicial review.\\nI would dismiss this appeal.\\nThe above (paras 90 113) is the judgment I wrote before an enlarged court of nine of us in November 2010 heard, and subsequently, on 23 March 2011, gave judgment in, R (Lumba and Mighty) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2011] UKSC 12; [2011] 2 WLR 671 (Lumba).\\nGiven that a majority of the court (6:3) held that the particular public law breaches committed by the Secretary of State there resulted in the appellants being falsely imprisoned albeit a differently constituted majority (also 6:3) held that they can recover no more than nominal damages should I (must I) now change my judgment and agree with the majority that Mr Kambadzi too was falsely imprisoned?\\nI have concluded not: it by no means follows from the majority view on liability in Lumba that there is liability here too and to my mind it would be still more undesirable to find liability established here than the minority of us thought it to be in Lumba itself.\\nThat the two cases are different is plain enough.\\nAs Lord Dyson observed in para 61 of his lead judgment: A somewhat similar problem arose in R (SK Zimbabwe) v Secretary of State for the Home Department In that case the unlawfulness lay in the failure of the Secretary of State to comply with her policy which prescribed the procedural requirements for reviews of FNPs who are already in detention.\\nThe present case concerns the substantive requirements for the initial detention of FNPs as well as their continued detention.\\nLady Hale too (para 198) recognised that on the issue of liability Lumba is a stronger case than is still before the court in SK (Zimbabwe) because the illegality alleged (and now admitted) went to the criteria for detention rather than to the procedure for authorising it.\\nAlthough, obviously, the court in Lumba was not required to consider the consequences in terms of liability of a public law failure to comply with the Secretary of States self imposed requirements for the review of continuing detention, there appear to me a number of passages in the judgments of those holding liability to be established there, strongly suggesting that they might well have taken a very different view in the present case.\\nThis is perhaps plainest at paras 193 and 194 of Lord Walkers judgment: It is a big step to extend the [Anisminic] principle to a claim for damages for false imprisonment, where a defendant may have his professional reputation at stake and may not enjoy the procedural protections which attend judicial review (strict time limits, and the discretionary nature of the remedy granted).\\nI would prefer a more demanding test, that in a case where an extant statutory power to detain has been wrongly used there would be a private law claim only if the misuse amounted to an abuse of power (including but not limited to cases of misfeasance or other conscious misuse of power). 194 However, it is in my opinion unnecessary to decide the point in these appeals because the conduct of officials, including some senior officials, of the Home Office between April 2006 and September 2008 amounted to a serious abuse of power.\\nLord Dyson SCJ has . described in restrained language how senior officials were well aware of the risk (indeed the likelihood) of challenge and decided to run the risk, (including the proposal to let immigration judges take any hit), and how further damaging facts were disclosed by stages, some before Davis J, some before the Court of Appeal and some only in this court.\\nWherever the line is to be drawn (if, as I think, a line does need to be drawn between public law errors in detention policies which do or do not give rise to an action for false imprisonment) these appeals must in my view fall on the wrong side of the line from the Secretary of States point of view.\\nGiven that a line is to be drawn between public law errors amounting to the sort of serious misconduct which Lord Walker was clearly intending to denote by his use of the expression abuse of power and other public law errors which do not give rise to actions for false imprisonment, it is very far from obvious that Lord Walker would regard the failures in the review process here as an abuse of power.\\nLord Collins too, having referred (at para 220) to the Home Offices deliberate decision . to continue an unlawful policy and to the cynical nature of its approach generally in these cases, expressed himself (at para 221) satisfied that the serious breach of public law in this case has the result that the detention of the appellants was unlawful (emphasis added).\\nEven Lord Dyson (para 68) expressly accepted that: It is not every breach of public law that is sufficient to give rise to a cause of action in false imprisonment.\\nIn the present context, the breach of public law must bear on and be relevant to the decision to detain.\\nThus, for example, the decision to detain made by an official of a different grade from that specified in a detention policy would not found a claim in false imprisonment.\\nIt seems clear, therefore, that Lord Dyson would have rejected Mr Kambadzis case at least in respect of the four monthly reviews carried out by officials of the wrong grade although, I acknowledge, it is unclear what conclusion he would have reached with regard to the twelve omitted reviews.\\nOf course, the three of us who dissented on liability in Lumba would by definition conclude that Mr Kambadzi must fail on liability in the present case.\\nAs for why, liability in Lumba notwithstanding, it would be wrong to find false imprisonment established here too, let me illustrate what seems to me the absurdity of such conclusion by the example I gave (at para 357) in Lumba: it would result in a detainee whose detention is reviewed every second month instead of monthly as the published policy dictates, alternat[ing] yo yo like between lawful detention and false imprisonment.\\nTo hold that false imprisonment is the consequence of a failure to comply with the substantive requirements for the initial detention of FNPs as well as their continued detention (Lord Dyson at para 61, quoted above) is one thing; to hold that the same consequence follows a failure to comply with the procedural requirements for reviews of FNPs who are already in detention (ibid) is quite another and to my mind a step altogether too far.\\nI therefore remain of the view, the authority of Lumba notwithstanding, that this appeal should be dismissed.\\nOn the issue of anonymity I agree with Lord Hope.\\nAs was recently established by the Courts comprehensive and authoritative judgment given by Lord Rodger in In re Guardian News and Media Ltd [2010] 2 AC 697, the general rule is that parties to proceedings are named and that an anonymity order has to be justified.\\nIn my opinion there is no justification for such an order here and, indeed, Mr Husain on behalf of the appellant suggests none and seeks no such order.\\nThere may, of course, be good reason in certain asylum cases for maintaining the asylum seekers anonymity notwithstanding that his claim fails: the very fact of his having made a claim, albeit unsuccessful, could on occasion tip the balance and give rise to a genuine fear of persecution or article 3 ill treatment where previously none existed.\\nDoubtless in any such case counsel, certainly counsel as expert and experienced as Mr Husain, would duly seek the necessary anonymity order.\\nGiven, however, that this appellants asylum claim was clearly bogus, it is unsurprising that no such application was made here and it is to my mind inconceivable that the appellants known involvement in these proceedings could give rise to any bona fide further asylum claim.\\n\""

              "'The issue in this appeal is whether a failure by the Respondent to comply with a procedural requirement in its policy relating to the detention of foreign national prisoners results in their detention being unlawful, so as to allow the detainee to advance a claim in tort for false imprisonment.\\nShepherd Masimba Kambadzi is a Zimbabwean national.\\nHe entered the UK lawfully, but remained here after his leave to remain expired.\\nIn 2005, he was convicted of assault and sexual assault, sentenced to one years imprisonment and ordered to be registered as a sex offender for five years.\\nPrior to his being released from prison, the Respondent decided to make a deportation order against the Appellant.\\nParagraph 2(2) of Schedule 3 to the Immigration Act 1971 (the 1971 Act) gives the Secretary of State the power to detain foreign nationals pending the making of a deportation order and the Appellant was detained under that power on 7 March 2006.\\nOn 24 August 2007, a deportation order was made against the Appellant, after which he was detained under paragraph 2(3) of Schedule 3 to the 1971 Act.\\nIn all, he was detained for 27 months until 13 June 2008, when he was granted bail.\\nHe has not yet been returned to Zimbabwe because of conditions in that country.\\nThe common law has recognised limits on the extent of the power to detain under paragraphs 2(2) and (3) of Schedule 3 to the 1971 Act (the Hardial Singh principles, set down in R v Governor of Durham Prison Ex p Hardial Singh [1984] 1 WLR 904).\\nThe Respondent had a policy which detailed how the power to detain was to be exercised.\\nIt provided, for example, that all reasonable alternatives to detention must be considered before detention was authorised.\\nThe policy also provided for detention to be subject to review at regular intervals.\\nIt specified the frequency of review and the grade of official which was to carry them out.\\nThe policy required the Appellants detention to be reviewed on five occasions during the first month and then monthly thereafter.\\nThe Appellants detention was not reviewed in accordance with that policy.\\nBy the date of the first instance hearing of this claim, he had been entitled to 22 monthly reviews of the lawfulness of his detention, in addition to the five reviews which should have taken place in the first month.\\nHis detention had been reviewed only ten times.\\nOnly six of those reviews had been conducted by officials of the required seniority and, of those six, two were flawed by material errors of fact.\\nThe substantive requirements for detaining the Appellant were, however, met throughout the period of his detention: had the Respondent carried out the reviews, it could justifiably have decided to continue to detain him.\\nWhile still detained, the Appellant raised a judicial review, seeking a declaration that he was unlawfully detained and damages.\\nAt first instance, Munby J granted a declaration that the Appellant had been unlawfully detained for various periods amounting to about 19 months and gave directions for the assessment of damages, but he declined to order his release. (The Appellant was subsequently granted bail in other proceedings.) The Court of Appeal allowed the Secretary of States appeal and held that the Appellants detention had been lawful throughout.\\nAlthough the Supreme Court heard the appeal in February 2010, it delayed handing down its judgment so as to be enable a court of nine Justices to consider the case of R (Lumba) v Secrteary of State for the\\nHome Department [2011] UKSC 12.\\nThat case also considered the legality of the detention of foreign national prisoners where the Secretary of State has not complied with the terms of the published policy relating to detention.\\nThe Supreme Court, by a majority, allows the appeal.\\nLord Hope gives the leading judgment; Lady Hale and Lord Kerr issue separate concurring judgments.\\nThe majority holds that the Appellants detention was unlawful for the periods in respect of which no review was carried out and that he does have a claim in tort for false imprisonment in respect of those periods.\\nThe amount of damages is yet to be ascertained, but will be nominal if it is found that the Appellant would have been detained even if his detention had been reviewed as the policy required.\\nLord Brown gives a dissenting judgment, with which Lord Rodger agrees.\\nThe Secretary of State was under a public law duty to adhere to the terms of the policy relating to reviews unless there were good reasons not to: [36], [39], [66].\\nThe majority of the Court holds that the Respondents unlawful failure to review the Appellants detention, as required by the policy, resulted in his detention being unlawful.\\nThe court rejects the argument that because the breach of public law related to a procedural requirement, it did not affect the legality of the detention: [69] [73], [85].\\nSome procedural requirements go to the legality of the detention and some do not: [71].\\nThe policy was sufficiently closely related to the authority to detain to qualify the Secretary of States discretion under the 1971 Act: [51].\\nThe very point of the review was to ensure that the detention was lawful: [73], [86].\\nThe public law error bore directly on the decision to detain the Appellant and therefore satisfied the test adopted by the majority in Lumba for determining when a public law error will result in detention being unlawful: [42], [88].\\nThe Appellants detention was not unlawful, however, where the only defect in the decision to continue detention was that the review had been carried out by an official of the wrong grade: [60].\\nAs the Court also held in Lumba, it was no defence to the claim that there were grounds which justified the Appellants detention: [54], [73], [88].\\nFalse imprisonment is a trespass to the person and actionable in itself, without proof of loss or damage: [74].\\nThe result of the reviews which should have taken place is, however, relevant to assessing damages.\\nA defendant is liable only for the loss which his wrongful act has caused.\\nThe full facts of this case are yet to be established, but if it is found that the claimant would not have been released had proper reviews been carried out, he will only be entitled to nominal damages: [55] [56], [74], [89].\\nLord Brown (with whom Lord Rodger agrees) would have held that the failure to review the Appellants detention did not result in the Appellants detention being unlawful.\\nThey hold that the policy did not confer upon the Appellant an entitlement to be released, but only an entitlement to be reviewed for release: [107].\\nOnce properly detained, a detainee remains lawfully imprisoned unless and until released on bail or by the Secretary of States direction, or he establishes a substantive entitlement to release: [111].\\nLumba does not compel the majoritys result, because it was concerned with a substantive entitlement under the policy and not a procedural one, and because it also held that not every breach of public law resulted in detention being unlawful: [116] [118].\\n'"

perma nent lease of the right to the underground coal in 5,800 bighas of land belonging to him to Shibsaran Singh and Sitaram Singh (hereinafter referred to as the Singhs) by a registered patta stipulating for a salami of Rs. 8,000 and royalty at the rate of 2a.\\nper ton of coal raised subject to a minimum of Rs. 8,000 and for certain other cesses and interest.\\nOn 7th June, 1921, Kumar executed another perma nent patta leasing the right to the coal in 500 bighas out of the 5,800 bighas referred to above to one Prayngji Bal lavji Deoshi and his son Harakchand Deoshi (hereinafter referred to as the Deoshis).\\nBy this document.\\n835 the Deoshis agreed inter alia to pay royalty at the rate of 2a. per ton on all classes of coal raised subject to a minimum of Rs. 750 a year.\\nThe Singhs feeling themselves aggrieved by the latter transaction brought a title suit (No. 1291 of 1921) in the Court of the Subordinate Judge of Dhanbad for a declaration of their title and for possession of the 500 bighas leased to the Deoshis under the aforesaid patta of 7th June, 1921.\\nTo that suit Kumar was made a party as defendant No. 3, the Deoshis being defendants 1 and 2.\\nThe suit was however cornpromised on 6th March, 1923, by all the parties and a decree based on the compromise was also passed on the same day.\\nThe interest of the Singhs was brought to sale in 193S in execution of a decree obtained against them and was purchased by the plaintiff who insti tuted the presnt suit on 3rd October, 1942, claiming the royalty and cesses payable under the compromise decree for the period from Pous 1345 to Asadh 1349 B.S. from defendants 1 and 2 as the representatives of the Deoshis who entered into the compromise of March, 1923.\\nIn order to appreciate the contentions of the parties, it is necessary to set out the relevant terms of the compro mise decree which are as follows : \\\"The plaintiffs (the Singhs) within two months from this date shall pay Rs. 8,000 as salami to defendant No. 3 (Kumar).\\nOtherwise all the terms of the compromise Will stand cancelled and the plaintiffs shall not be competent to claim any right to or possession over the.land covered by the patta dated 11th March, 1921.\\nThe patta which defend ant No. 3 executed in favour of the plaintiffs in respect of 5,800 bighas of coal land in village Rahraband shall remain in force, and the plaintiffs will get a decree of declara tion of their right and title to the 500 bighas of coal land in dispute but defendants 1 and 2 (the Deoshis) shall hold possession as tenants.\\nBesides the terms mentioned below, defendants 1 and 2 shall remain bound by all the remaining terms under which they took settlement of the 500 bighas of coal land from defendant No. 3 under 836 patta and Kabuliyat, and both the defendants 1 and 2 shall possess the same under the plaintiffs from generation to generation and all the terms of the said patta and Kabuliyat shall remain effective and in force between them.\\nBoth the defendants 1 and 2 shall remain bound to pay to the plain tiffs commission at the rate of 2a.\\nper ton on all sorts of coal instead of 2a.\\na ton as stated before in the patta of 5,800 bighas of land settled with the plaintiffs.\\nThe plaintiffs shall pay to defendant No. 3 in future the mini mum royalty of Rs. 6,000 instead of Rs. 8,000 as stipulated in the original patta of 11 th March 1921 and commission at the rate of la.\\na ton in place of 2a.\\na ton as stipulat ed in the patta of March 21 .\\nUnless the plaintiffs pay to the defendant No. 3 Rs. 8,000 within 2 months from this day they shall not be competent to take out execution of this decree, nor shall they be competent to take posses sion of the land in dispute.\\nThe defendants 1 and 2 within one month from the date of payment of Rs. 8,000 as aforesaid to defendant No. 3 shall execute a new Kabuliyat in favour of the plaintiff in respect of the modified terms stated above, i.e., on the condition to pay commission at the rate of 2a.\\nper ton.\\nIn the new patta which defendant No. 3 will execute in favour of the plaintiffs he shall embody the condition that the annual minimum royalty will be Rs. 6,000 instead of Rs. 8,000 and commission will be at the rate of la. 9p.\\nper ton in place of 2a.\\nper ton as mentioned in the aforesaid patta.\\nIf the defendant No. 3 does not execute the parts on the aforesaid modified terms in favour 'of the plaintiffs within the time aforesaid and both the defendants 1 and 2 also do not execute a kabuliyat on the aforesaid modified terms, then this very rafanama shall be treated as the parts and kabuliyat, and the plaintiffs in accordance with the terms of the rafanama shall pay to defendant No. 3, Rs. 6,000 only as minimum royalty and commission at the rate of la.\\nper ton with respect to 5,800 bighas and shall continue to realise commission at the rate of 2a. 6p. per ton from defendants 1 and 2 who shall remain bound to pay the same.\\n\\\" 837 The answer to the question whether this compromise decree requires registration depends on the legal effect of the changes in the status quo ante of the parties brought about by the document.\\nA careful analysis reveals the following alterations : (1) In the lease to the Singhs, the rate of royalty or commission was reduced from 2a.\\nper ton of coal raised to la.\\nper ton and the minimum royalty was reduced from Rs. 8,000 to Rs. 6,000 while the area of coal land in their khas possession was reduced by 500 bighas. (2) In the lease to the Deoshis the rate of royalty or commission was enhanced from 2a.\\nper ton to 2a.\\nper ton and tiffs was made payable to the Singhs.\\nThe Singhs and the Deoshis were brought into a new legal relationship, the former accepting the latter as tenants holding the disputed 500 bighas under them in consideration of the latter agreeing to pay the enhanced royalty to the former. (4) The whole arrangement was made conditional on the Singhs paying Rs. 8,000 to Kumar within 2 months from the date of the compromise, it being expressly provided that the Singhs were not to be entitled to execute the decree or to take possession of the disputed area of 503 bighas which evidently had not till then passed into their possession.\\nNow, sub section (1) of section 17 of the , enumerates five categories of documents of which regis tration is made compulsory which include\\\" (d) leases of immoveable property from year to year, or for any term exceeding one year, or reserving a yearly rent;\\\".\\nSub sec tion (2) however provided that \\\"nothing in clauses (b) and (c) of sub section (1)applies to . (vi) any decree or order of court.\\n\\\" It may be mentioned in passing that this clause was amended with affect from the 1st April, 1930, by the , so as to exclude from the scope of the exception compromise decrees comprising immovable property other than that which is the subject matter of the suit.\\nBut 838 the amendment cannot affect the document here in question which came into existence in 1923.\\nBefore the amendment, the clause was held to cover even compromise decrees comprising immovable property which was not the subject matter of the suit: [Vide Hemanta Kumari Debi vs Midnapur Zamindari Co. ( ')].\\nThat decision applies to the present case and obviates the objection that because the compromise in question covered also the remaining 5,300 bighas which were not the subject matter of the title suit of 1921, it was outside the scope of the exception in sub section (2), clause (vi).\\nThe only question, therefore, is whether the compromise decree is a \\\"lease\\\" [which expression includes \\\"an agreement to lease\\\" by the definition in section 2 (7)] within the meaning of el.\\n(d) of sub section (1).\\nIt is obvious that if the compromise decree fails within clause (d) of sub section (1) it would not be protected under clause (vi) of sub section (2) which excepts only documents falling under the categories (b) and (c) of sub section (1).\\nThe High Court was of opinion that, on a proper construction of the terms of the compromise, it did not fall under clause (d).\\nMano har Lall J., who delivered the leading judgment, observed: \\\"It was a tripartite agreement embodied in the decree of the court and was, therefore, exempt from registration.\\nIt will be oh.served also that so far as the defendants were con cerned, their possession of the 500 bighas was not inter fered with and they still remained in possession as the lessees, but instead of paying the royalty to the plaintiffs it was agreed between all the parties that the defendants would pay the royalty in future to Shibsaran and Sitcram.\\nIf the matter had stood there, the learned Advocate for the appellant could not have seriously contested the position, but he vehemently argued that when the agreement was not to pay the same amount of royalty or commission as previously agreed to but an altered amount of royalty and commission, the document should be held to fall within the mischief of section 17 (1)(d)of the (1) P.C. 839 .\\nThe answer to this contention is, as I have stated just now, to be found in the Full Bench decision of this court :\\\" [see Charu Chandra Mitra 's case ()].\\nIt was there held that a mere alteration of the rent reserved does not make the transaction a new lease so as to bring it within clause (d)of subsection (1).\\nWe are unable to share this view.\\nIt oversimplifies the compromise transaction which, in our opinion, involves much more than a mere alteration of the royalties stipulated for in the previous pattas executed by Kumar.\\nNor can we accept the suggestion of Mr. Chatterjee for the respondents theft the compromise operated as an assignment to the Singhs by Kumar of the latter 's reversion under the \\\"lease granted to the Deoshis and all that the latter did was to acknowledge the Singhs as their landlords and attern to them.\\nOn tiffs view it was said that the transaction would not fall under clause (d), although it would fall under clause (b) but then would be saved by the exception in clause (vi) of sub section (2).\\nThe argument, however, overlooks that Kumar had leased the area of 5,800 bighas to the Singhs by his patta dated 11th March, 1921, and the compromise by providing that the Singhs should pay the reduced royalty of 1a.\\nper ton in respect of the whole area preserved Kumar 's reversion intact.\\nHe could not therefore be deemed to have assigned any part of his inter est in 5,800 bighas as landlord to the Singhs who continue to hold the entire extent as tenants under him.\\nWhat the compromise really did was.\\nas stated already, to bring the Singhs and the Deoshis into a new legal relationship as underlessor and under lessee in respect of 500 bighas which were the subject matter of the title suit; in other words, its legal effect was to create a perpetual underlease be tween the Singhs and the Deoshis which would clearly fall under clause (d) but for the circumstance that it was to take effect only on condition float the Singhs paid Rs. 8,000 to Kumar within 2 months (1) 840 thereafter.\\nAs pointed out by the Judicial Committee in Hemanta Kumar 's case (1) \\\"An agreement for a lease, which a lease is by the statute declared to include, must, in their Lordships ' opinion, be a document which effects an actual demise and operates as a lease .\\nThe phrase which in the context where it occurs and in the statute in which it is found, must in their opinion relate to some document which creates a present and immediate interest in the land.\\n\\\" The compromise decree expressly provides that unless the sum of Rs. 8,000 was paid within the stipulated time the Singhs were not to execute the decree or to take possession of the disputed property.\\nUntil the payment was made it was impossible to determine whether there would be any under lease or not.\\nSuch a contingent agreement is not within clause (d) and although it is covered by clause (b). is excepted by clause (vi) of sub section ( '2).\\nWe therefore agree with the conclusion of the High Court though on dif ferent grounds and dismiss the appeal with costs.\\nAppeal dismisseel.\\n\",\n          \"Appeal No. 198 of 1954.\\nAppeal from the judgment and order dated October 16, 1952, of the former Nagpur High Court in Misc.

Shroff, for the respondent.\\n64 502 1960.\\nNovember 18.\\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by IMAM, J.\\nThis is an appeal from the judgment of the Nagpur High Court dismissing the appellants petition under articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution of India.\\nThe High Court certified under article 132(1) of the Constitution that the case involved a substantial question of law as to the interpretation of the Constitution.\\nHence the present appeal.\\nThe appellant was the Ruler of the State of Baster.\\nAfter the passing of the Indian Independence Act, 1947, the appellant executed an Instrument of Accession to the Dominion of India on August 14, 1947.\\nThereafter, he entered into an agreement with the Dominion of India popularly known as \\\"The Stand Still Agreement\\\".\\nOn December 15, 1947, he entered into an agreement with the Government of India whereby he ceded the State of Baster to the Government of India to be integrated with the Central Provinces and Berar (now the State of Madhya Pradesh) in such manner as the Government of India thought fit.\\nCon sequently the Governments in India came to have exclusive and plenary authority, jurisdiction and powers over the Baster State with effect from January 1, 1948.\\nThe Legislature of the State of Madhya Pradesh passed the Madhya Pradesh Abolition of Proprietary Rights (Estates, Mahals, Alienated Lands) Act, 1950 (Madhya Pradesh Act 1 of 1951), hereinafter referred to as the Act, which received the assent of the President of India on January 22, 1951.\\nThe preamble of the Act stated that it was one to provide for the acquisition of the rights of proprietors in estates, mahals, alienated villages and alienated lands in Madhya Pradesh and to make provisions for other matters connected therewith.\\nUnder section 3 of the Act, vesting of proprietary rights in the State Government takes place on certain conditions,, mentioned in that section, being complied with.\\nThe definition of 'proprietor ' is stated in section 2 cl.\\n(m) and it is \\\"in relation to 503 (i) the Central Provinces, includes an inferior proprietor, a protected thekadar or other thekadar, or protected headman; (ii) the merged territories, means a maufidar including an ex Ruler of an Indian State merged with Madhya Pradesh, a Zamindar, Ilaquedar, Khorposhdar or Jagirdar within the meaning of wajib ul arz, or any sanad, deed or other instrument, and a gaontia or a thekadar of a village in respect of which by or under the provisions contained in the wajib ul arz applicable to such village the maufidar, the gaontia, or the thekadar, as the case may be, has a right to recover rent or revenue from persons holding land in such village;\\\".\\nThe definition of 'mahal ' is stated in section 2(j) and it is \\\"mahal\\\", in relation to merged territories, means any area other than land in possession of a raiyat which has been separately assessed to land revenue, whether such land revenue be payable or has been released, compounded for or redeemed in whole or in part;\\\".\\nBefore the High Court the appellant contended that he was still a Sovereign Ruler and absolute owner of the villages specified in Schedules A and B of his petition under articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution.\\nHe urged that his rights had been recognized and guaranteed under the agreements entered into by him with the Government of India.\\nThe provisions of the Act, therefore, did not apply to him.\\nIt was further contended that the provisions of the Act did not apply to a Ruler or to the private property of a Ruler which was not assessed to land revenue.\\nHe relied on article 6 of the Instrument of Accession and the first paragraph of article 3 of the Merger Agreement.\\nThe High Court held that if the petitioner 's rights under article 6 of the Instrument of Accession and article 3 of the Merger Agreement had been infringed it was clear from the provisions of article 363 of the Constitution that interference by the courts was barred in disputes arising out of these two instruments.\\nThe High Court was also of the opinion that article 362 of the Constitu tion was of no assistance to the appellant.\\n504 After referring to the definition of the word 'proprietor ' in the Act, the High Court was of the opinion that the word 'maufidar ' in section 2(m) of the Act had not been used in any narrow or technical sense.\\nA 'maufidar ' was not only a person to whom a grant of maufi lands had been made but was also one who held land which was exempt from the payment of \\\"rent or tax\\\".\\nIt accordingly rejected the contention on behalf of the appellant that the word 'maufidar ' is necessarily confined to a grantee from the State or Ruler and therefore a Ruler could not conceivably be a maufidar.\\nThe High Court also rejected the contention on behalf of the appellant that as he was a \\\"Ruler\\\" within the meaning of that expression in article 366(22) of the Constitution he did not come within the expression 'ex Ruler ' as contained in the definition of the word 'proprietor ' in the Act.\\nThe expression 'Ruler ' as defined in article 366(22) of the Constitution applied only for interpreting the provisions of the Constitution.\\nThe expression 'ex Ruler ' given in the Act must therefore be given the ordinary dictionary meaning.\\nAccording to Shorter Oxford English Dictionary, 'Ruler ' means \\\"one who, or that which, exercises rule, especially of a supreme or sovereign kind.\\nOne who has control, management, or head ship within some limited sphere\\\".\\nThe High Court accordingly took the view that although the appellant did exercise such a rule in the past he ceased to exercise it in his former Domain after the agreements of accession and merger had come into operation.\\nAccordingly the appellant must be regarded as an ex Ruler and as he was also a maufidar he fell within the definition of the word 'proprietor ' in the Act.\\nThe question whether the villages mentioned in Schedules A and B of the petition under articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution fell in any of the categories, \\\"Estates, Mahals, Alienated lands\\\", was also considered by the High Court.\\nIn its opinion they did not fall within the category of Estates or Alienated lands but they did fall within the category of Mahals.\\nAccording to the definition of 'Mahal ' in section 2(j) of the Act the same must be separately assessed to land 505 revenue.\\nAccording to the appellant they had not been assessed to land revenue but this was denied on behalf of the State of Madhya Pradesh.\\nThe High Court was of the opinion that in these circumstances it was for the appellant to establish that the villages in question had never been assessed to land revenue but no evidence had been led to this effect.\\nOn the contrary, according to the High Court, it would appear from the documents on the record that the villages known as 'Bhandar villages ' had been assessed to land revenue.\\nAs the rest of the villages in Schedule A and the villages in Schedule B, upto the date of the High Court judgment, had not been recognized as the private property of the appellant by the Government of India as required by the second and third paragraphs of the Merger Agreement, the appellant could not assert his ownership over them.\\nThe High Court, accordingly, dismissed his petition under articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution.\\nTwo questions in the main were urged before us (1) whether the appellant is a proprietor within the meaning of that expression in the Act and (2) whether the villages in question came within the definition of the word 'mahal ' contained in the Act.\\nOn behalf of the appellant it had also been urged that the Act could not defeat the rights of the appellant guaranteed under article 3 of the Merger Agreement.\\nIt seems clear to us, however, that in view of the provisions of article 363(1) of the Constitution any dispute arising out of the Merger Agreement or the Instrument of Accession is beyond the competence of the courts to enquire into.\\nThe High Court rightly decided this point against the appellant.\\nWith reference to the first point we would first consider whether the appellant is an ex Ruler for the purposes of the Act.\\nThat he is so factually cannot be denied, since he ceded his State to the Government of India to be integrated with the Central Provinces and Berar (now the State of Madhya Pradesh) in such manner as the Government of India thought fit.\\nHe further ceded to the Government ' of India full and exclusive authority, jurisdiction and powers in relation 506 to the governance of his State when he agreed that the administration of that State would be transferred to the Government of India as from January 1, 1948.\\nThe question is whether his recognition for the purposes of the Constitution as Ruler by virtue of the provisions of article 366(22) of the Constitution of India continues his status as a Ruler for purposes other than the Constitution.\\narticle 366(22) states: \\\" \\\"Ruler\\\" in relation to an Indian State means the Prince, Chief or other person by whom any such covenant or agreement as is referred to in clause (1) of article 291 was entered into and who for the time being is recognised by the President as the Ruler of the State, and includes any person who for the time being is recognised by the President as the successor of such Ruler\\\".\\nArticle 291 refers to the privy purse payable to Rulers.\\nIt states: \\\"Where under any covenant or agreement entered into by the Ruler of any Indian State before the commencement of this Constitution, the payment of any sums, free of tax, has been guaranteed or assured by the Government of the Dominion of India to any Ruler of such State as privy purse (a) such sums shall be charged on, and paid out of, the Consolidated Fund of India; and (b) the sums so paid to any Ruler shall be exempt from all taxes on income.\\n\\\" Article 291 refers to any covenant or agreement entered into by the Ruler of any Indian State before the commencement of the Constitution.\\nThe covenant or agreement referred to in this Article certainly includes the Instrument of Accession and the Merger Agreement.\\nThe effect of the Merger Agreement is clearly one by which factually a Ruler of an Indian State ceases to be a Ruler but for the purposes of the Constitution and for the purposes of the privy purse guaranteed, he is a Ruler as defined in article 366(22) of the Constitution.\\nThere is nothing in the provisions of article 366(22) which requires a court to recognise such a person as a Ruler for purposes outside the Constitution.\\nIn our opinion, the High Court rightly held that 507 the appellant was an ex Ruler and that article 366(22) of the Constitution did not make him a Ruler for the purposes of the Act.\\nAs the appellant was an 'ex Ruler ', he was within the class of persons who were by name specifically included in the definition of 'proprietor ' and therefore clearly within the scope of the Act.\\nThat the appellant was not only an ex Ruler but a maufidar appears to us to be clear.\\nThe ordinary dictionary meaning of maufi is \\\"Released, exempted, exempt from the payment of rent or tax, rent free\\\" and maufidar is \\\"A holder of rent free land, a grantee\\\".\\nIt was common ground in the High Court that the villages in question were exempt from the payment of rent or tax.\\nIn our opinion, the High Court rightly took the view that the expression 'maufidar ' was not necessarily confined to a grantee from a State or a Ruler of a State.\\nA maufidar could be a person who was the holder of land which was exempted from the payment of rent or tax.\\nIn our opinion, the appellant certainly came within the expression 'maufidar ' besides being an ex Ruler ' of an Indian State merged with Madhya Pradesh.\\nIt is, however, contended on behalf of the appellant that the most important part of the definition was the concluding portion where it was stated that in the case of a maufidar he must be a person who by or under the provisions contained in the wajib ul arz applicable to his village, had the right to recover rent or revenue from persons holding land in such village.\\nIt was contended that even if the appellant was a maufidar, there was nothing to show that with reference to any village held by him it was entered in the wajib ul arz, that he had a right to recover rent or revenue from persons holding land in such village.\\nIn the petition under articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution, filed by the appellant in the High Court, it was nowhere asserted that even if he was regarded as a maufidar it was not entered in the wajib ul arz with respect to any of his maufi villages that he had a right to recover rent or revenue from persons holding land in such villages.\\nFrom the judgment of the High 508 Court it would appear that no such argument was advanced before it.\\nIn the application for a certificate under article 132(1) of the Constitution we can find no mention of this.\\nIn the statement of the case filed in this Court also there is no mention of this fact.\\nThere is thus no material on the record to establish that the appellant as a maufidar had no right to recover rent or revenue from persons holding land in his villages.\\nThe burden was on the appellant to prove this fact which he never attempted to discharge.\\nIt is impossible therefore to accept this contention on behalf of the appellant raised for the first time before us in the course of the submissions made on behalf of the appellant.\\nRegarding the second point arising out of the definition of 'Mahal ', the High Court definitely found that the petitioner had given no evidence to establish that the villages in question were not assessed to land revenue.\\nOn the contrary, at least with reference to the Bhandar villages documents on the record showed that these villages had been assessed to land revenue.\\nSince it was a question of fact whether the villages had been assessed to land revenue, which was denied on behalf of the State of Madhya Pradesh, the High Court rightly held that the contention of the appellant in this respect could not be accepted.\\nAs for the other villages, in Schedules A and B of the petition of the appellant under articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution the High Court, in our opinion, rightly held that the petition was not maintainable as these villages had not yet been recognised by the Government of India as the private property of the appellant.\\nIn our opinion, the appeal accordingly fails and is dismissed with costs.\\nAppeal dismissed.\\n\",\n          \"iminal Appeal No. 40 of 1951, 127 Appeal from the Judgment and Order dated the 1st June, 1951, of the High Court of Judicature in Assam (Thadani C.J. and Ram Labhaya J.,) in Criminal Reference No. I of 1951, arising out of Judgment and Order dated the 15th November, 1950, of the Court of the Additional District Magistrate, Lakhimpur, in Case No. 1126C of 1950.\\nJindra Lal for the appellant.\\nNuruddin Ahmed for the respondent.\\nOctober 23.\\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by CHANDRASEKHARA AIYAR J.\\nRameshwar Bhartia, the appellant, is a shopkeeper in Assam.\\nHe was prosecuted for storing paddy without a licence in excess of the quantity permitted by the Assam Food Grains Control Order, 1947.\\nHe admitted storage and possession of 550 maunds of paddy, but pleaded that he did not know that any licence was necessary.\\nThe 'Additional District Magistrate recorded a plea of guilty, but imposed him a fine of Rs. 50 only, as he considered his ignorance of the provisions of the Food Grains Control Order to be genuine.\\nThe stock of paddy was left in the possession of the appellant by the Procurement Inspector under a Jimmanama or security bond executed in his favour.\\nHe was subsequently unable to produce it before the court, as the whole of it was taken away by a Congress M.L.A. for affording relief to those who suffered in the earthquake, and so, the appellant was ordered to procure a similar quantity of paddy after taking an appropriate licence, and to make over the same to the procurement department payment of the price.\\nThe District Magistrate, being moved to do so by the procurement department, referred the case to the High Court under section 438, Criminal Procedure Code, for enhancement of the sentence, as in his opinion the sentence was unduly lenient and the Jimmanama, which was admittedly broken, should have been forfeited.\\n128 The reference was accepted by the High Court, and the sent ence was enhanced to rigorous ' imprisonment for six months and a fine of Rs. 1,000.\\nAs regards the Jimmanama, the case was sent back to the trial court for taking action according to law under section 514, Criminal Procedure Code, for its forfeiture.\\nThe appellant applied to the High.\\nCourt for a certificate under article 134 (1) (c) of the Constitution that the case was a fit one for appeal to this Court.\\nThis application was granted.\\nOut of the three points urged for the appellant, two were rejected, but the third one was accepted as a good ground, namely, that there was a contravention of the provisions of section 556, Criminal Procedure Code and that consequently the, trial before the Additional District Magistrate was void.\\nOne of the contentions urged before us was that Shri C.K. Bhuyan was not a \\\"Director\\\" at all and therefore there was no valid sanction under section 38 of the Order.\\nA notifications dated 16th May) 1950, and published in the Assam Gazette of the 24th May, 1950, was produced before us to show that Sri C.K. Bhuyan was an Additional Deputy Commissioner and it was conceded by the appellant 's counsel before the High Court that if he was a Deputy Commissioner, he would be a Director under the Order, as all Deputy Commissioners in Assam were notified as Directors for the purposes of the Order.\\nMr. Jindra Lal sought to draw a distinction between a Deputy Commissioner and an Additional Deputy Commissioner in this respect, but there is no warrant for the same,, apart from the circumstance that it is a question of fact which has to be investigated afresh, and which we cannot allow to be raised now for the first time.\\nThe primary question to consider in this appeal is whether there has been any infringement of Section 556, Criminal Procedure Code, and a consequent want of jurisdiction in the court which tried the offence.\\nThe facts relevant to this question lie 129 within a narrow compass.\\nThe Procurement Inspector sent a report , Ist July,1950 about the nature of the offence ; he wrote out a short note the, subject, and requested that the accused might be prosecuted and the Assistant Director of Procurement, Dibru garh, might be authorised to dispose of the paddy immediately to avoid loss due to deterioration, Sri 0.\\nK. Bhuyan,who was the then District Magistrate Lakhimpur, made the following order: \\\"Prosecution sanctioned under section 7 (1) of ,the Essential Supplies (Temporary Powers) Act, 1946, for violation of sections 3 and 7 of the Assam Food Grains Oontrol Order, 1947.\\n\\\" The case happened to be tried by the same gentleman in his capacity as Addtional District Magistrate, and the accused was convicted as aforesaid.\\nThe argument for the appellant was that having sanctioned the prosecution, Sri C.K. Bhuyan became \\\"personally interested\\\" in the case within the meaning of section 556, and was therefore incompetent to try the same.\\nIt was contended that the trial was not only irregular but illegal.\\nThere is no question that \\\"personal interest\\\" within the meaning of the section is not limited to private interest, and that it may well include official interest also.\\nBut what is the extent of the interest which will attract the disability is a subject which different views are possible and have been taken.\\nSection 556 itself indicates the difficulty.\\nThe Explanation to the section runs in these terms: \\\"A Judge or Magistrate shall not be deemed a party, or personally interested, within the , meaning of this section, to or in any case by reason only that be is a Municipal Commissioner or otherwise concerned therein in a public capacity, or by reason only that he has viewed the place in which an offence, is alleged to have been committed, or any other place .in which any other transaction material to the case 'is alleged to have occurred, and made an inquiry III connection with the case.\\n\\\" 130 This shows that to be connected with a case in a public capacity is not by itself enough to render the person incompetent to try it.\\nEven if he had made an enquiry in connection with this case, it would not matter.\\nBut look at the illustration: \\\"A, as collector, upon consideration of information furnished to him, directs the prosecution of B for a breach of the excise laws.\\nA is disqualified from trying this case as a Magistrate.\\n\\\" It is evident from the words of the illustration that if a prosecution is directed by a person in one capacity, he shall not try the case acting in another capacity as a Magistrate.\\nThe explanation and illustration lend some support to the view that there is a distinction between a passive interest and an active interest, and that it is only in the latter case that the disqualification arises or intervenes.\\nUnder sub section (3) (a) of section 2 of the Assam Food Grains Control Order \\\"Director\\\" means \\\"the Director of Supply, Assam, and includes, for the purpose of any specific. provision of this Order, any other officer duly authorised in that behalf by him or by the Provincial Government by notification in the Official Gazette.\\n\\\" Section 38 provides: No prosecution in respect of an alleged contravention of any provision of this Order shall be instituted without the sanction of the Director.\\n\\\" A little confusion is likely to arise from the employment of the word \\\" Director\\\" in the Control Order and the word \\\"directs\\\" in the illustration to section 556 of the Code '.\\nIt has to be borne in mind that a sanction by the Director within the meaning of the Code does not necessarily mean \\\"a direction given by him that the accused should be prosecuted.\\n\\\" In both cases of sanction and direction, an application of the mind is necessary, but there is this essential difference that in the one case there is a legal impediment to the prosecution if there be no sanction, and in the other case, there is a positive order that 131 the prosecution should be launched.\\nFor a sanction, all that is necessary for one to be satisfied about is the existence of a prima facie case.\\nIn the case of a, direction, a further element that the accused deserves to be prosecuted is involved.\\nThe question whether a Magistrate is personally interested or not has essentially to be decided the facts in each case.\\nPecuniary interest, however small, will be a disqualification but as regards other kinds of interest, there is no measure or standard except that it should be a substantial one, giving rise to a real bias, or a reasonable apprehension the part of the accused of such bias.\\n, The maxim \\\" Nemo debet esse judex in propria sua causa\\\" applies only when the interest attributed is such as to render the case his own cause.\\nThe fulfllment of a technical requirement imposed by a statute may not, in many cases, amount to a mental satisfaction of the truth of the facts placed before the officer.\\nWhether sanction should be granted or not may conceivably depend upon consideration extraneous to the merits of the case.\\nBut where a prosecution is directed, it means that the authority who gives the direction is satisfied in his own mind that the case must be initiated.\\nSanction is in the nature of a permission while a direction is in the nature of a command.\\nLet us now examine some of the decisions the subject.\\nFor the appellant, strong reliance was placed the judgment of the Privy Council in Gokulchand Dwarkadas vs King(1), and it was argued the basis of some of the observations of the Judicial Committee that a sanction was an important and substantial matter and not a mere formality.\\nThe facts in that case were that while there was a sanction of the Government for a prosecution under the Cotton Cloth and Yarn Control, Order, there was nothing in the sanction itself, or in the shape of extraneous evidence, to show that the sanction was accorded after the relevant facts were placed before the sanctioning authority.\\nTo quote their Lordships ' own words; (1) (1948) 52 C.W.N.325.\\n132 \\\"There is no evidence to show that the report of the Sub Inspector to the District Superintendent of Police, which was not put in evidence, was forwarded to the District Magistrate, nor is there any evidence is to the contents of the endorsement of the District Magistrate, referred to in the sanction, which endorsement also was not put in evidence.\\nThe prosecution was in a position either to produce or to account for the absence of the 'report made to the District Superintendent of Police and the endorsement of the District Magistrate referred to in the sanction, and to call any necessary oral evidence to supplement the documents and show what were the facts which the sanction was given.\\n\\\" It is in this connection that their Lordships em phasise that the sanction to prosecute is an important step constituting a condition precedent, and observe: \\\"Looked at as a matter of substance it is plain that the Government cannot adequately discharge the obligation of deciding whether to give or withhold a sanction without a knowledge of the facts of the case.\\nNor, in their Lordships ' view, is a sanction given without reference to the facts constituting the offence a compliance with the actual terms of clause 23.\\n\\\" This, however, is no authority for the position that a sanction stands the same footing as a direction.\\nIt is true that the facts should be known to the sanctioning authority ; but it is not at all necessary that the authority should embark also an investigation of the facts, deep or perfunctory, before according the sanction.\\nThe decision lends no support to the view that wherever there is a sanction, the sanctioning authority is disabled under section 556 of the Code from trying the case initiated as a result of the sanction. the other hand, there is plenty of support for the opposite) view.\\nIn the very early case of The Government of Bengal vs HeeraLall Dass and Others(1), at a time when there (1) (1872) 17 Weekly Reporter, Criminal Rulings, 39. 133 was no such statutory provision as section 556 of the Code but, only the general rule of law that a man could not be judge in a case in which he had an interest, the facts were that a Sub Registrar, who was also an Assistant Magistrate, having come to know in his official capacity as a registering officer that an offence under the Registration Act had been committed, sanctioned a prosecution, and subsequently tried the case himself.\\nA Full Bench consisting of Sir Richard Couch C. ' J. and five other learned Judges came to the conclusion, after an examination of some of the English cases, that the trial was not vitiated.\\nThe learned Chief Justice said: \\\"In this case, I think, the Sub Registrar has not such an interest in the matter as disqualifies him from trying the case; and I may observe with reference to some of the arguments that have been used as to the Sub Registrar having made up his mind, and that the accused would have no chance of a fair trial, that the sanction of the superior officer, the Registrar, is required before the prosecution can be instituted, and certainly I do not consider that the prosecution will not be instituted unless the Sub Registrar has made up his mind as to the guilt of the party.\\nIt is his duty, when he comes to know that an offence has been committed, to cause a prosecution to be instituted, by which I understand that there is prima facie evidence of an offence having been committed, that there is that which renders it proper that there should be ail enquiry, and the Registrar accordingly gives his sanction to it ; and certainly, I cannot suppose that, because an officer in his position sanctions the institution of a prosecution, his mind is made up as to the guilt of the party and .\\nthat he is not willing to consider the evidence which may be produced before him when he comes to try the case.\\nIn this case, there appears to 'be no such interest as would prevent the case from going\\\" before the Magistrate as the trying authority . 134 In Queen Empress vs Chenchi Reddi(1) it was pointed out that when there was only an authorisation and not a direction, there was no supervening disability ; and the case of Girish Chunder Ghose vs The QueenEmpress(2) was distinguished, the ground that there the Magistrate had taken a very active part in connection with the case as an executive officer.\\nThe Bombay High Court went even a step further in the case reported in Emperor vs Bavji(3), where the Magistrate who tried the case had earlier held a departmental enquiry and forwarded the papers to the Collector with his opinion that there was sufficient evidence to justify a criminal prosecution.\\nAs he did no more than express an opinion that there was evidence, which he, had neither taken nor sifted, which made a criminal prosecution desirable, it was held that the Magistrate was not disqualified from holding the trial, though, no doubt it would have been more expedient had the Collector sent the case for disposal to another of his subordinates.\\nAs stated already, the question whether the bar under section 556 comes into play depends upon the facts and circumstances of each particular case, the dividing line being a thin one somewhat but still sufficiently definite and tangible, namely, the removal of a legal impediment by the grant 'of sanction and the initiation of criminal proceedings as the result of a direction.\\nIn the present case before us, we have nothing more than a sanction, and consequently we are unable to hold that the trial has become vitiated by reason of the provisions of section 556, Criminal Procedure Code.\\nThe other point taken behalf of the appellant is a more substantial one.\\nThe security bond was taken from him not by the court but by the Procurement Inspector.\\nIt is true that it contained the undertaking that, the seized paddy would be produced before the court, but still it was a promise made to the particular official and not to the court.\\nThe High (1) Mad. 238.\\n(3) (19O3) (2) Cal.\\n857. 135 Court was in error in thinking that section 514, Criminal Procedure Code, applied.\\nAction could be taken only when the bond is taken by the court under the provisions of the Code such as section 91 for appearance, the several security sections or those relating to bail.\\nClause (1) of section 514 runs: \\\"Whenever it is proved to the satisfaction of the, Court by which a bond under this Code has been taken, or of the Court of a Presidency Magistrate or Magistrate of the first class, or when the bond is for appearance before a Court, to the satisfaction of such Court, that such bond has been forfeited, the Court shall record the grounds of such proof, and may call upon any person bound by such bond to pay the penalty thereof, or to show cause why it should not be paid.\\n\\\" The language is perfectly clear; the power to forfeit and the imposition of the penalty provided for in the later parts of the section arise only if the preliminary conditions are satisfied.\\nThere was no argument addressed to us that the High Court in suggesting that action should be taken under section 514 for forfeiture of the bond acted in the exercise of its inherent powers under section 561 A.\\nIt did not purport to exercise any such power; and, moreover, there will then arise the question whether when the Code contains an express provision a particular subject, there could be any resort to inherent jurisdiction, under a general provision.\\nWe have got an additional circumstance in the appellant 's favour in this case that the seized paddy was taken away by a member of the Legislative Assembly for giving relief to those affected by the earthquake, and if that is true, as it seems to be from the letter written by the ' M.L.A. to the Additional District Magistrate the 1st November, 1950, it appears to us harsh, if not unjust, to ask him to produce the same paddy or a similar quantity of paddy.\\nThe order of the High Court sending back the case to the 136 Magistrate for taking action according to law under section 514 will, therefore, stand set aside.\\nWe generally do not interfere in the matter of sentence, but in this case we find that the Magistrate has held that the appellant 's plea that he was ignorant of the provisions of the Assam Food Grains Control Order, 1947, was a genuine one.\\nHaving regard to this circumstance and the fact that from a fine of Rs. 50 to 6 months ' rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 1,000 is a big jump, we think it is appropriate that the sentence of imprisonment imposed by the High Court should be set aside and we order accordingly.\\nThe fine of Rs. 1,000 will stand.\\nSentence reduced.\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"dataset_name\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"IN-Abs\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"summary\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"An agreement for a lease, which a lease is by the Indian declared to include, must be a document which effects an actual demise and operates as a lease.\\nIt must create present and immediate interest in land.\\nWhere a litigation between two persons A and B who claimed to be tenants under C was settled by a compromise decree the effect of which was to create a perpetual underlease between A and B which was to take effect only on condition that A paid Rs. 8,000 to C within a fixed period: Held, that such a contingent agreement was not \\\"a lease\\\" within el.\\n(a) of section 17 (t) of the Indian , and even though it was covered by cl.\\n(b) of the said sec tion it was exempt from registration under el.\\n(vi) of subs.\\n(2) of section 17.\\nHemanta Kumari Debi vs Midnapur Zamindari Co.

Bhattacharya and P. K. Chatterjee, for appellants.\\nN.C. Chatterjee, A. V. Viswanatha Sastri, R. section Chatterji and D. N. Mukherjee, for respondents Nos. 2 to 6. 1961.\\nMarch 22.\\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by SUBBA RAO, J.\\nThis appeal by certificate granted is directed against the judgment of the High Court of Judicature at Patna dated April 23, 1953, confirming that of the Subordinate Judge, Dhanbad, dated November 30, 1946.\\nThe plaintiffs and the defendant are adjoining colliery owners at Kujama.\\nThe plaintiffs ' land lies immediately to the south of the defendants ' land.\\nOn August 2, 1,894, Raja of Jharia granted mukarrari lease of the coal and coal mining rights in 300 bighas of land in village Kujama to Satya Karan Banerjee and Girish Chandra Samanta.\\nOn June 15,1900, his son, Raja Durga Prasad Singh, granted coal and coal 494 mining rights in respect of 400 bighas out of 592 bighas to one Jugal Kishore Lal.\\nSamanta purchased the leasehold interest of Banerji, and thereafter on November 23, 1900, it appears that Samanta bad surrendered his rights under the previous lease in favour of the Raja and taken a fresh lease of the same 300 bighas on a reduced rent.\\nOn June 10, 1901, Jugal Kishore Lal granted a lease of 96 bighas out of his 400 bighas to one D. M. Mathews.\\nOn the very same day D. M. Mathews, in his turn, granted a lease to one Walji Kheta in respect of the said 96 bighas.\\nWalji Kheta executed a kabuliat in favour of M. Mathews on October 11, 1901.\\nWalji Kheta represented the defendants.\\nBy diverse transfers, the interest of Samanata vested in Bagdigi Kujama Collieries Limited.\\nThe plaintiffs case was that as a result of a letter written by the Inspector of Mines on August 18, 1941, the plaintiffs made an inquiry and came to know that the defendants had encroached upon their coal mines on the northern side and removed coal from the encroached portion and had rendered the remaining coal of the encroached portion unworkable.\\nOn those allegations, they asked for the following reliefs: (a)That the intermediate boundary line between the plaintiffs ' coal land and the defendants ' coal land be ascertained and fixed.\\n(b)That the area encroached upon by the defendants be ascertained and the defendants be directed to vacate the same,.\\n(c)That a permanent injunction be issued against the defendants restraining them from encroaching upon the plaintiffs ' coal land and cutting and removing coal therefrom.\\n(d)That an enquiry be made and the quantity of coal cut and removed by the defendants from the plaintiffs ' coal land as also the quantity of the coal rendered unworkable be ascertained and a decree for the value thereof by way of damages be granted to the plaintiffs against the defendants.\\nThe defendants denied that they had encroached upon the plaintiff , ' coal land and stated that the suit was barred by limitation.\\nThey further pleaded that the 495 plaintiffs would not be entitled to any damages.\\nThe learned Subordinate Judge held that the defendant had encroached upon the plaintiff ' coal land, that the suit was not barred by limitations and that they would be entitled to the reliefs prayed for.\\nOn appeal, the High Court of Patna accepted all the findings of the learned Subordinate Judge and dismissed the appeal.\\nHence the present appeal.\\nThe first question that arises for consideration is whether the defendants had encroached Upon the plaintiffs ' coal land.\\nThe answer to this question depends upon the correct, delineation of the boundary line between the plaintiffs ' leasehold and the defendants ' leasehold.\\nIt is common case that the southern boundary of the appellants ' leasehold is conterminous with the northern boundary of the respondents ' lease hold.\\nLearned counsel for the appellant contends that the said boundary should be fixed solely with reference to the boundaries given in the lease of 1894, whereas learned counsel for the respondents contends that no plan has been annexed to the said lease and, therefore, the boundary could more satisfactorily and definitely be fixed with reference to the plans annexed to the subsequent lease deeds executed in favour of the successors in interest of the appellant and the respondents.\\nTo appreciate the rival contentions it is necessary to consider the various lease deeds in some detail.\\nOn August 2, 1894, Raja Jaimangal Singh executed the lease deed (exhibit 1) in respect of 300 bighas in favour of the respondents ' predecessor in interest.\\nIn that lease deed the northern boundary is described to be the remaining portion of mauza Kujama and the western boundary is described as Chatkari Jorh.\\nThe foot note to the lease reads, \\\"measuring 1101 feet in length running north and south by the side of the said Chatkari Jorh and area being 300 bighas by such measurement\\\".\\nNo plan was annexed to this lease deed.\\nOn June 15, 1900, Jugal Kishore Lal, the predecessor in interest of the appellant, had obtained a lease (exhibit C) of 400 bighas 496 from Raja Durga Prasad Singh, the son of the previous Raja.\\nThe southern boundary of this leasehold is given as the northern boundary limit of the leasehold land of Girish Chandra Samanta and others and the western boundary is shown as the eastern boundary of Chatkari Jorh as per the map annexed.\\nThis lease deed clearly shows that the southern boundary of this plot is conterminous with the northern boundary of the leasehold land in favour of Samanta.\\nIt may also be noticed at this stage that the map annexed to this lease deed has not been filed by the appellants.\\nIt appears that Samanta purchased the interest of Banerji in the leasehold of 1894 and thereafter at the request of Samanta, on November 23, 1900, Durga Prasad Singh gave a fresh lease of the same holding to Samanta and incorporated a map in that lease, i.e., exhibit 3(b).\\nThere, the northern boundary of the leasehold is described as the leasehold of Rajkumar Jugal Kishore Lal Singh Bahadur.\\nThe plan, exhibit 3(b), annexed to this lease deed shows the boundary line between the two leaseholds.\\nThe said plan is drawn to scale and the boundary line is drawn between point A marked in the plan and point B marked therein.\\nAs the plan is a part of the lease deed, it is clear from the plan that the northern boundary of the leasehold of Samanta is the said line.\\nOn June 10, 1901, Jugal Kishore Lal, that is, the predecessor in interest of the appellant demised a plot of 96 bighas carved out from his leasehold to Mathews under a deed exhibit C(1).\\nMathews in turn demised under exhibit D the said land of 96 bighas to Walji Khetan representing the appellant.\\nIn both these documents the southern boundary is shown as the northern boundary of the leasehold land of Samanta.\\nOne interesting feature is that a map has been referred to in each of the documents and the said map shows that the line drawn from point A to point B is the boundary between the two leaseholds.\\nIt may be mentioned that the said boundary line is exactly the same as that found in exhibit 3(b).\\nThese documents to which the defendants ' predecessors were parties contain a clear admission that the boundary line between the two leaseholds i.e., between appellant 's and that of the respondents ' is the line between 497 A and B shown in plan exhibit 3(b).\\nWe have no doubt that if the plan annexed to exhibit C was produced by the appellant, it would have also established that the dividing line between the two leaseholds is that found in exhibit 3(b).\\nThe appellant, in our view, has suppressed the said plan and, therefore, in the circumstances, we are justified to draw an inference that, if produced, it would be against appellant 's contention.\\nFrom the aforesaid documentary evidence we hold, agreeing with the courts below, that the southern boundary of the appellant 's holding, which is conterminous with the northern boundary of the respondents ' holding, is the line between points A and B shown in exhibit 3(b).\\nThe next question addressed by the courts below is how to ascertain the point A.\\nThe argument of learned counsel for the appellant is that the map translated into words indicates that the correct boundary should be a line drawn from the true meeting point of the four villages Pandebera, Jharia Khas, Lodhna and Kujama at a bearing of 82.15 ', whereas the contention of the respondents is that the line actually drawn on the lease map correctly lays down the northern boundary of the respondents ' leasehold.\\nIt is settled law that a map referred to in a lease should be treated as incorporated in the lease and as forming part of the document: see Darapali Sadagar vs Najir Ahamed (1).\\nAs in this case the map is drawn to scale and incorporated in the lease deed, it is not permissible to ignore the starting point of the boundary line and adopt instead any scientific point based on survey.\\nThe Commissioner appointed by the court tested the position of the six trijunction pillars shown in the map of lease dated November 23, 1900, and found that two of the trijunction pillars were in their correct positions.\\nOn the basis of these two trijunction pillars, the Commissioner relaid, by the process of superimposition, the northern boundary line of the leasehold property, The point A in the map so laid does not tally with the point where the aforesaid four villages actually meet.\\nHe pointed out that the correct (1)(1923) I.L.R 50 Cal 394 63 498 point where the said four villages met would be 1680 feet only from the trijunction pillar of Lodhna, Kujama and Madhuban, whereas the point A was at a distance of 1750 feet from the said trijunction pillar.\\nBut learned counsel for the appellant contends that according to exhibit 3 the western boundary should be according to the revenue plan and, therefore, point A should be fixed at a distance of 1680 feet from the trijunction pillar, as that is the distance according to the revenue plan.\\nBut a perusal of exhibit I shows that there is no reference in regard to the western boundary to revenue records.\\nThat apart, even if 1680 feet is taken as the distance between the injunction pillar and point A in 'the map, it demonstrates that the measurement given in exhibit 3 was incorrect, for, there the distance was shown only as 1101 feet.\\nBut a more serious objection to the argument is that it is not permissible for a court to reconstruct the plan with reference to revenue records when the plan is self contained and drawn to scale.\\nTo summarize: the question is whether the disputed extent is part of the respondents ' holding or that of the appellant 's holding.\\nThe map, exhibit 3(b), annexed to the lease deed executed in favour of the respondents ' predecessor in interest clearly demarcates the boundary line between the holdings of the appellant and the respondents, and according to that plan the disputed extent falls within the boundary of the respondents ' holding.\\nThe lease of the appellant 's predecessor, i.e., exhibit C, also refers to a map, but the appellant withheld it.\\nIn the sub leases created by the appellant, maps were annexed and the boundary therein is in accord with that in exhibit 3(b).\\nThose documents contain clear admissions supporting the case of the respondents.\\nNo reliance can be placed upon the recitals in exhibit 1, as it is demonstrated that the extent given in respect of the western boundary is incorrect.\\nOn the aforesaid material both the courts have held that the disputed extent of land is part of the holding of the respondents.\\nIt is well settled that a map referred to in a lease should be treated as incorporated in the lease and as 499 forming part of the said document.\\nIn this case the maps accepted by us are drawn to scale and the boundary is clearly demarcated.\\nThe courts were, therefore, certainly right in accepting the boundaries drawn in the plan without embarking upon an attempt to correct them with reference to revenue records.\\nThe question really is one of fact and we accept the finding.\\nThe next question is whether the suit was barred by limitation.\\nThe encroachment by the appellant on the respondents ' colliery and the removal of coal therefrom are alleged to have taken place in or about the year 1932.\\nThe respondents in the plaint averred that they came to know of the said encroachment and removal of coal by the appellant after they received the letter dated August 18, 1941, from the Inspector of Mines and before that they had absolutely no knowledge or information whatsoever regarding thereto.\\nThe appellant denied the said allegation and stated that the respondents all along knew and had been aware that the portion of coal land in question belonged to and was the property of the appellant.\\nIn particular the appellant alleged that the respondents must have the knowledge of it since 1932 when there was a survey by the Department of Mines.\\nOn the said pleadings issue 3 was framed which reads, \\\"Is the suit barred by limitation?\\\" The learned Subordinate Judge found, on the evidence, that the proceedings in 1932 had nothing to do with the delineation of the boundary line between the two holdings.\\nHe held that article 48 of the Limitation Act applied to the suit and that the appellant had failed to prove that the respondents had knowledge of the sinking of the quarries and pits in the encroached land.\\nOn appeal the High Court accepted the finding.\\nThough the High Court held that the burden of proof to establish knowledge on the part of the respondents beyond the prescribed time was on the appellant, it has given the finding on the assumption that the initial burden was on the respondents to prove that they had knowledge of the said encroachment only within three years thereof.\\nThere are, therefore, concurrent findings of fact on the 500 question of knowledge.\\nBut learned counsel for the appellant contended that the finding is vitiated by the burden of proof having been wrongly thrown on the appellant.\\nThis submission is not accurate, for, as we have pointed out, the High Court arrived at the finding of fact on the assumption that the initial burden of proof was on the respondents.\\nIt is common case that article 48 of the Limitation Act governs the period of limitation in respect of the present suit.\\nIt reads: ___________________________________________________________ Period Time from Description of suit.\\nof which period limitation begins to run.\\n___________________________________________________________ For specific moveable When the per property lost, or son having acquired by theft, or the right to dishonest misappro the posses priation or conver Three sion of the sion, or for com years.\\nproperty first pensation for wrong learns in ful taking or detain whose posses ing the same.\\nsion itis.\\n__________________________________________________________ The article says that a suit for recovery of specific movable property acquired by conversion or for compensation for wrongful taking or detaining of the suit property should be filed within three years from the date when the person having the right to the possession of the property first learns in whose possession it is.\\nThe question is, on whom the burden to prove the said knowledge lies? The answer will be clear if the article is read as follows: A person having the right to the possession of a property wrongfully taken from him by another can file a suit to recover the said specific moveable property or for compensation therefore within three years from the date when lie first learns in whose possession it is.\\nObviously where a person has a right to sue within three years from the date of his coming to know of a, certain fact, it is for him to prove that he had the knowledge of the said fact on a particular date, for 501 the said fact would be within his peculiar knowledge.\\nThat apart, section 3 of the Limitation Act makes it obligatory on a court to dismiss a suit barred by limitation, although limitation has not been set up as a defence, indicating thereby that it is the duty of a plaintiff to establish, at any rate prima facie, that the suit is within time.\\nIt is the obligation of the plaintiff to satisfy the court that his action is not barred by lapse of time: see Lalchand Marwari vs Mahanth Rampur Gir (1) and Rajah Sahib Perhlad Sein vs Maharajah Rajender Kishore Sing (2) .\\nLooking from a different perspective, we arrive at the same result.\\nUnder the Evidence Act there is an essential distinction between the phrase \\\"burden of proof\\\" as a matter of law and pleading and as a matter of adducing evidence.\\nUnder section 101 of the Evidence Act, the burden in the former sense is upon the party who comes to court to get a decision on the existence of certain facts which he asserts.\\nThat burden is constant throughout the trial; but the burden to prove in the sense of adducing evidence shifts from time to time having regard to the evidence adduced by one party or the other or the presumption of fact or law raised in favour of one or the other.\\nIn the present case the burden of proof in the former sense is certainly on the respondents.\\nBut the question is whether they have adduced evidence which had the effect of shifting the onus of proof to the appellant.\\nOn behalf of the respondents, their Colliery Manager was examined as P. W. 2.\\nHe stated in his evidence that the appellant had encroached upon the South Kujamal Colliery in Seam Nos. 10, 11 and 12 and another special seam, known as 4 feet seam and that in August, 1941, be came to know about the encroachment for the first time when the Mines Department forwarded a plan of the joint workings of the two collieries of the parties.\\nHe also stated that he had no knowledge of the encroachment before.\\nIn the cross examination, two suggestions were made to him, namely, that in 1932 there was a survey of the plaintiffs ' and defendants ' coal land by the Mines Department and that Seam Nos. 11 and 12 were (1) Pat. 312.\\n(2) (1869) 12 M.I.A. 292.\\n502 worked by the appellant by open quarry system.\\nHe denied that he had any knowledge of the said two facts.\\nThe evidence of this witness has been accepted by the learned Subordinate Judge, and the High Court also accepted his evidence, though in its view it was not very satisfactory.\\nThis evidence, therefore, prima facie, proves that the respondents had knowledge of the encroachment only in 1941.\\nLet us now consider some of the decisions cited at the Bar.\\nA division beach of the Patna High Court in Sundarji Shivji vs Secretary of State for India (1) held that \\\"when a defendant in an action based on tort seeks to show that the suit is not maintainable by reason of the expiry of the statutory period of limitation, it is upon him to prove the necessary facts\\\".\\nThere the suit was for conversion of property, and the learned Judges applied article 48 of the Limitation Act to the said suit.\\nAfter noticing the words in the last column of the article, the learned Judges proceeded to observe thus: \\\" The starting date of limitation in the case of conversion is the date when the person who has the right to possession first learns of the act of conversion.\\n\\\" Adverting to the burden of proof, the learned Judges observed: \\\"There is nothing in the pleadings which would show precisely at what period tile plaintiff or the plaintiff 's agent, which is the same thing, became aware of the sale and its wrongfulness, that is to say, became aware of the fact of conversion.\\nThe defendant was unable to provide us with any materials to fix that date and therefore his plea of limitation fails altogether, because he is unable to show a date outside the period of three years which would entitle him to succeed.\\n\\\" With great respect to the learned Judges, we hold that this case had not been correctly decided.\\nThe burden of proof, as we have explained earlier is on a plaintiff who asserts a right, and it may be, having regard to the circumstances of each case, that the (1) Pat, 752, 760.\\n503 onus of proof may shift to the defendant.\\nBut to say that no duty is cast upon the plaintiff even to allege the date when they had knowledge of the defendant 's possession of the converted property and that the entire burden is on the defendant is contrary to the tenor of the article in the Limitation Act and also to the rules of evidence.\\nA division bench of the Calcutta High Court in Kalyani Prasad Singh vs Borrea Coal Co. Ltd. (1) did not accept the view of the Patna High Court, but followed that of the Bombay High Court in the Bank of Bombay vs Fazulbhoy Ebrahim (2).\\nIn the context of the application of article 48 of the Limitation Act, the learned Judges of the Calcutta High Court observed thus: \\\"The burden of proof rests upon the party who substantially asserts the affirmative of the issue. .\\nWe are of opinion that the onus is upon the plaintiff in these suits to prove that the knowledge of his father wag within three years of the suit.\\n\\\" In Talyarkhan vs Gangadas (3), Rangnekar, J., formulated the legal position thus: \\\"The onus is on the plaintiff to prove that he first learnt within three years of the suit that the property which he is seeking to recover was in the possession of the defendant.\\nIn other words, he has to prove that he obtained the knowledge of the defendant 's possession of the property within three years of the suit, and that is all.\\nIf he proves this, then to succeed in the plea of limitation the defendant has to prove that the fact that the property was in his possession became known to the plaintiff more than three years prior to the suit.\\n\\\" We accept the said observations as representing the correct legal position on the subject.\\nThe appellant gave evidence to show that the encroachment was prior to 1932, but there is no acceptable evidence on their part to establish that the respondents came to know of the removal of coal by the appellant or their possession of the coal removed beyond three years prior to the suit.\\nLearned counsel (1) A.I.R. 1946 Cal.\\n123,127 (2) (3) Bom.\\n848, 860.\\n504 took us through the correspondence that passed between the parties and the Mining Department in 1932.\\nBut it does not prove that the respondents had knowledge of the fact that the appellant had encroached upon any portion of their coal mines.\\nEmphasis is also laid upon the fact that there was quarry system of working in the mines and a contention is advanced that quarrying is done openly and, therefore, the respondents must have had knowledge of the said fact.\\nBut the courts found from Commissioner 's maps that in the encroached portion, there were only underground workings and that the quarries were mostly outside the encroached area.\\nThe learned Subordinate Judge and the High Court refused to base any finding on mere probabilities without clear evidence to sustain them.\\nWe cannot therefore hold that the findings of the courts are vitiated by an error of law by the burden of proof having been wrongly thrown on the appellant.\\nWe accept the findings of the High Court that the respondents had knowledge of the appellant 's encroachment of their coal mines only in the year 1941 which was within three years of the date of the filing of the suit.\\nThe only other outstanding question that remains for consideration is that covered by Issue No. 7.\\nIn paragraph 11 of the plaint, the plaintiffs allege that under the Indian Mines Act and the Rules and Regulations made thereunder the plaintiffs are bound to keep a barrier of 25 feet to the south of the defendant 's working and, therefore, the coal that is still left in the encroached area is not by any means accessible to the plaintiffs and being thus wholly unworkable is entirely lost to them for ever.\\nIn the written statement the defendants did not deny the fact that the coal still left in the encroached area was lost to the plaintiffs, but only stated that it was purely a question of statutory obligation on the part of the plain.\\ntiffs with which the Defendant had nothing to do.\\nThe learned Subordinate Judge accepted the case of the plaintiffs and held that the coal that was left in the encroached area was entirely lost to them by being rendered unworkable.\\nThe High Court accepted the finding.\\nLearned counsel for the appellant contends that under the Rules the respondents could request the mining authorities to exempt them from the operation of rule 76 of the Indian Coal Mines Regulation, 1946, and if exemption was granted, they could remove the coal left by the appellant in the encroached area.\\nThis possibility of the respondents getting an exemption from the operation of the rule was not raised either before the learned Subordinate Judge or before the High Court.\\nNor can we hold in favour of the appellant on the basis of such a possibility.\\nWe, therefore, accept the concurrent finding of fact arrived at by the courts below in respect to this issue.\\nNo other point was raised.\\nThe appeal fails and is dismissed with costs.\\nAppeal dismissed.\\n\",\n          \"Civil Appeal No. 50 of 1961.\\nAppeal by special leave from the Award dated March 10, 1959, of the Industrial Tribunal.\\nKozhikode, in I.D. No. 89 of 1958.\\nA. V. Viswanatha Sastri and T. V. R. Tatachari, for the appellant, Janardan Sharma, for the resondents.\\nJanuary 29.\\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by WANCHOO.J.\\nThis is an appeal by special leave in an industrial matter.\\nThe brief facts necessary for present purposes are these.\\nThe appellant in a saw mill carrying on business in Kozihkode in 824 the State of Kerala.\\nOne Sankaran was in the employ of the appellant as a crosscutter.\\nIt is said that on June 21, 1958, Sankaran came drunk to they mill and abused the Engineer, the Secretary and others and threatened them with physical violence.\\nHe was caught hold of by other workmen and taken outside.\\nIt is said that he came again a short time later at 4 30 p.m. and abused the same persons again.\\nThereupon the appellant served a charge sheet on Sankaran on June 24, 1958 acting out the above facts and asked him to show cause why his services should not be terminated on account of his grave indiscipline and misconduct.\\nSankaran gave an explanation the same day denying the allegations of fact made against him, though he admitted that he had come to the mill at the relevant time for taking his wages for that week.\\nOn June 25, 1958 Sankaran was informed that in view of his denial, a departmental inquiry would be held and he was also placed under suspension pending inquiry.\\nThe same day Sankaran protested against his suspension and requested that in any case the departmental inquiry should be expedited.\\nAs no inquiry was held till July 2, 1958, Sankaran again wrote to the appellant to hold the inquiry as early as possible.\\nOn July 8, 1958, the appellant terminated the services of Sankaran under r. 18 (a) of the Standing Orders without holding any departmental inquiry and the order was communicated to Sankaran the same day.\\nIn that order the appellant informed Sankaran that the proposed inquiry, if conducted, would lead to further friction and deterioration in the rank and file of the employees in general and also that maintenance of discipline in the undertaking would be prejudiced if he was retained in the service of the appellant, and therefore it considered that no inquiry should be held.\\nA dispute was then raised by the union which was referred to the industrial tribunal for adjudication by the Government of Kerala in October 1958.\\nThe tribunal held that 825 something seemed to have happened on the afternoon of June 21, 1958 but there was no evidence to prove what had actually happened.\\nIt further held that the appellant had intended to take disciplinary action against the workman but subsequently departmental proceedings were dropped and action was taken under r. 18(a) of the Standing orders.\\nThe tribunal was of the view that this was a colourable exercise of the power given under r. 18(a) to the appellant and therefore its action could not be upheld as a bona fide exercise of the power conferred.\\nThe tribunal also pointed out that no attempt was made before it to defend the action taken under r. 18 (a) by proving the alleged misconduct.\\nTwo witnesses were produced before the tribunal in connection with the alleged misconduct, but the tribunal did not rely on them on the ground that the important witnesses, namely, the Engineer, the Secretary and other members of the staff whose evidence would have been of more value had not been produced and no explanation had been given why they were not produced.\\nThe tribunal therefore held that on the facts it could not come to the conclusion that Sankaran had come drunk to the mill and abused or attempted to assault either the Engineer or the Secretary or other officers.\\nIn the result the order of discharge was set aside and Sankaran was ordered to be reinstated.\\nThe appellant thereupon applied for special leave which was granted; and that is how the matter has come up before us.\\nThe main contention of the appellant is that it is entitled under r. 18 (a) of the Standing Orders to dispense with the service of any employee after complying with its terms.\\nRule 18 (a) is in these terms: \\\"When the management desires to determine the services of any permanent workmen 826 receiving 12 as.\\nor more as daily wages, otherwise than under rule 21, he shall be given 14 days notice or be paid 12 days wages.\\n\\\" It may be mentioned that r. 21 deals with case of misconduct and provides for dismissal or suspension for misconduct and in such a case the workman so suspended is not entitled to any wages during the period of suspension.\\nThe claim thus put forward on behalf of the appellant is that it is entitled under r. 18(a) of the Standing orders which is a term of contract between the appellant and its employees to dispense with the service of any employee at any time by just giving 14 days notice or paying 12 days wages.\\nWe are of opinion that this claim of the appellant cannot be accepted, and it is too late in the day for an employer to raise such a claim for it amounts to a claim \\\"to hire and fire\\\" an employee as the employer pleases and thus completely negatives security of service which has been secured to industrial employees through industrial adjudication for over a long period of time now.\\nAs far back as 1952, the Labour Appellate Tribunal had occasion to consider this matter relating to discharge by notice or in lieu thereof by payment of wages for a certain period without assigning any reason: (see Buckingham and Carnatic Co. Ltd. Etg.\\nvs Workers of the Company.\\netc.) (1).\\nIt was of opinion that even in a case of this kind the requirement of bona fides is essential and if the terminataton of service is a colourable exercise of the power or as a result of victimisation or unfair labour praction the industrial tribunal would have the jurisdiction to intervene and set aside such termination.\\nFurther it held that where the termination of service is capricious, arbitrary or unnecessarily harsh on the part of the employer judged by normal standards of a reasonable man that may be cogent evidence of victimisation or unfair labour practice.\\nThese observations 827 of the Labour Appellate Tribunal were approved by this Court in The Chartered Bank, Bombay vs The Chartered Bank Employees ' Union (1).\\nand Assam Oil Company vs Its Workmen (2).\\nTherefore if as in this case the employer wanted to take action for misconduct and then suddenly dropped the departmental proceedings which were intended to be held and decided to discharge the employee under r. 18 (a) of the Standing orders, it was clearly a colourable exercise of the power under that rule in as much as that rule was used to get rid of an employee instead of following the course of holding an inquiry for misconduct, notice for which had been given to the employee and for which a departmental inquiry was intended to be held.\\nThe reason given by the appellant in the order terminating the services of Sankaran of July 8, 1958, namely, that the proposed inquiry, if conducted, would lead to further friction and deterioration in the rank and file of the employees in general and also that maintenance of discipline in the undertaking would be prejudiced if Sankaran were retained in service, cannot be accepted at its face value; so that the necessity for an inquiry intended to be held for misconduct actually charged might be done away with.\\nIn any case even if the inquiry was not held by the appellant and action was taken under r. 18 (a) it is now well settled, in view of the decisions cited above, that the employer could defend the action under r. 18(a) by leading evidence before the tribunal to show that there was in fact misconduct and therefore the action taken under r. 18(a) was bona fide and was not colourable exercise of the power under that rule.\\nBut the tribunal has pointed out that the employer did not attempt to do so before it.\\nIt satisfied itself by producing two witnesses but withholding the important witnesses on this question.\\nIn the circumstances, if the tribunal did not accept the evidence of the two witnesses 828 who were produced it cannot be said to have gone wrong.\\nLearned counsel for the appellant however urges that the employer was empowered to take action under r. 18 (a) of the Standing orders and having taken action under that rule, there was nothing for it to justify before the tribunal.\\nWe have already said that this position cannot be accepted in industrial adjudication relating to termination of service of an employee and has not been accepted by industrial tribunals over a long course of years now and the view taken by industrial tribunals has been upheld by this Court in the two cases referred to above.\\nLearned counsel for the appellant, however, relies on the decision of this Court in Parshotam Lal Dhingra vs Union of India.\\n(1) That was however a case of a public servant and the considerations that apply to such a case are in our opinion entirely different.\\nStress was laid by the learned counsel on the observations at p. 862 where it was observed as follows: \\\"It is true that the misconduct, negligence inefficiency or other disqualification may be the motive or inducing factor which influences the Government to take action under the terms of the contract of employment or the specific service rule, nevertheless, if a right exists under the contract or the rule, to terminate the service, the motive operating on the mind of the Government is, as Chagla C. J. has said in Srinivas Ganesh vs Union of India (2) (supra), wholly irrelevant.\\nIt is urged that the same principle should be applied to industrial adjudication.\\nIt is enough to say that the position of government servants stands on an entirely different footing as compared to industrial employees.\\nArticles 310 and 311 of the Constitution apply to government servants and it is in the 829 light of those Articles read with the Rules framed under article 309 that questions relating to termination of service of government servants have to be considered.\\nNo such constitutional provisions have to be considered when one is dealing with industrial employees.\\nFurther an employer cannot now press his right purely on contract and say that under the contract he has unfettered right \\\"to hire and fire\\\" his employees.\\nThat right is now subject to industrial adjudication and even a power like that granted by r. 18 (a) of the Standing orders in this case, is subject to the scrutiny of industrial courts in the manner indicated above.\\nThe appellant therefore cannot rest its case merely on r. 18 (a) and say that having acted under that rule there is nothing more to be said and that the industrial court cannot inquire into the causes that led to the termination of service under r. 18 (a).\\nThe industrial court in our opinion has the right to inquire into the causes that might have led to termination of service even under a rule like 18(a) and if it is satisfied that the action taken under such a rule was a colourable exercise of power and was not bona fide or was a result of victimisation or unfair labour practice it would have jurisdiction to intervene and set aside such termination.\\nIn this case the tribunal held that the exercise of power was colourable and it cannot be said that view is incorrect.\\nThe appellant failed to satisfy the tribunal when the matter came before it for adjudication that the exercise of the power in this case was bona fide and was not colourable.\\nIt could have easily done so by producing satisfactory evidence; but it seems to have rested upon its right that no such justification was required and therefore having failed to justify its action must suffer the consequences.\\nLearned counsel for the appellant also drew our attention to another decision of this Court in 830 The Patna Electric Supply Co. Ltd. Patna vs Bali Rai(1).\\nThat case in our opinion has no application to the facts of this case because that case dealt with an application under section 33 of the Industrial Disputes Act while the present proceedings are under section 10 of the Act and the considerations which apply under section 33 are different in many respects from those which apply to an adjudication under section 10.\\nThe appeal therefore fails and is hereby dismissed with costs.\\nAppeal dismissed.\\n\",\n          \"Appeals Nos. 45 and 46 of 1959.\\nAppeal by special leave from the judgment and order dated March 25, 1957, of the former Bombay High Court in Appeal No. 16 of 1957.\\nQ.

No. 46/59).\\n926 1960.\\nSeptember 27.\\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by DAS GUPTA J.\\nM/s.\\nDaulatram Rameshwarlal, a firm registered under the Indian Partnership Act (referred to later in this judgment as \\\"sellers \\\") are registered dealers under section 11 of the Bombay Sales Tax Act.\\nIn their return of turnover for the period from April 1, 1954 to March 31, 1955, they claimed exemption from Sales Tax in respect of sales of cotton of the total value of Rs. 68,493 2 6 and sales of castor oil of the total value of Rs. 6,47,509 1 6 on the ground that these sales were oil FOB contracts, under which they continued to be the owners of the goods till the goods had crossed the customs barrier and thus entered the export stream, and so no tax was realisable on these sales in view of the provisions of article 286 (1)(b).\\nThe Sales Tax Officer rejected this claim for exemption and assessed them to sales tax on a taxable turnover including these sales.\\nHe also assessed them to purchase tax under section 10(b) of the Bombay Sales Tax Act on their purchase of castor oil which they later sold for the sum of Rs. 6,47,509 1 6 as mentioned above.\\nThe notice of demand for the total sales tax and the purchase tax assessed was served on the sellers on September 30, 1956.\\nThe sellers thereupon moved the Bombay High Court under article 226 of the Constitu tion for the issue of appropriate writs for quashing the order of assessment and the notice of demand and for prohibiting the Sales Tax Officer from taking any steps pursuant to the order or the notice.\\nThe learned Judge who heard the petition rejected the sellers ' contention that the goods remained their property till these crossed the customs frontier and therefore held that the sellers were not entitled to the benefit of article 286(1)(b) of the Constitution.\\nAs regards the assessment to purchase tax also he rejected the sellers ' contention that the assessment in question was illegal.\\nIn this view the learned Judge dismissed the application under article 226.\\nAgainst this decision the sellers appealed.\\nThe 927 learned Judges who heard the appeal held, disagreeing with the Trial Judge, that the goods remained the sellers ' property till the goods had been brought on board the ship and so the sales were exempted from tax under article 286(1)(b) of the Constitution.\\nThey however agreed with the Trial Judger that the sellers were liable to pay purchase tax under section 10(b) of the Bombay Sales Tax Act.\\nAccordingly they directed the Sales Tax Officer not to enforce the demand for payment of sales tax with regard to the sales of cotton for Rs. 68,493 2 6 and sale of castor oil of the total value of Rs. 6,47,509 1 6.\\nThe Sales Tax Officer has, on the strength of special leave granted by this Court, preferred the appeal which has been numbered as Civil Appeal No. 45 of 1959 against the appellate court 's order directing him not to realise the sales tax in respect of sales of cotton and castor oil.\\nCivil Appeal No. 46 of 1959 has been preferred by the sellers against the appellate court 's judgment in so far as it upheld the assessment of purchase tax under section 10(b).\\nThe only \\\"question for our decision in the appeal by the Sales Tax Officer is whether property in the goods passed on shipment or at some point of time before shipment.\\nThe law is now well settled that if the property in the goods passes to the buyer after they have for the purpose of export to a foreign country crossed the customs frontier the sale has taken place \\\"in course of the export\\\" out of the territory of India.\\nIf therefore in the present sales the property in the goods passed to the buyers on shipment, that is, after they had crossed the customs frontier the sales must be held to have taken place \\\"in the course of export\\\" and the exemption under article 286(1)(b) will come into operation.\\nThe sellers ' case is that these were sales on FOB contracts.\\nThough the learned Solicitor General appearing on behalf of the Sales Tax Officer tried to convince us that these were not really FOB contract sales, it appears that the averment in Paras.\\n11 and 13 of the writ petition that these sales were made on FOB basis were not denied in the counter affidavit sworn by the Sales Tax Officer.\\nIt is also 928 worth noticing that in the assessment order itself the Sale Tax Officer referred to these sales as sales on FOB basis.\\nThe specimen contract produced also used the words \\\" FOB delivered \\\".\\nThere can be no doubt therefore that these were sales under FOB contracts. ' The normal rule in FOB contracts is that the property is intended to pass and does pass on the shipment of the goods.\\nIn certain circumstances, e.g., if the seller takes the bill of , lading to his own order and parts with it to a third person the property in the goods, it has been held, does not pass to the buyer even on shipment.\\nWe are not concerned here with the question whether the passing of property in the goods was postponed even after shipment.\\nThe correctness of the proposition that in the absence of special agreement the property in the goods does not pass in the case of a FOB contract until the goods are actually put on board is not disputed before us.\\nAs has however been rightly stressed by the learned Solicitor General it is always open to the parties to come to a different agreement as to when the Dropert in the goods shall pass.\\nThe question whether there was such a different agreement has to be decided on a consideration of all the surrounding circumstances.\\nHe relies on three circumstances to convince us that the sellers and their buyers agreed in these sales that the property will pass to the buyer even before shipment.\\nThe first circumstance on which he relies is that the bill of lading was taken in the name of the buyer.\\nAlong with this fact we have to consider however the fact that the bill of lading was retained by the sellers, the contract being that payment will be made on the presentation of the bill of lading.\\nIt is not disputed that the term in the contract for \\\"payment at Bombay against presentation of documents \\\" means this.\\nIt was the sellers who received the bills of lading and it was on the presentation of these bills of lading along with the invoices that the buyer paid the price.\\nWhen the bills of lading though made out as if the goods were shipped by the buyer, were actually obtained and retained by the sellers, that fact itself would ordinarily indicate an intention of 929 the parties that the property in the goods would not pass till after payment.\\nThe second circumstance to which our attention has been drawn is that the export was under the contract to be under the buyer 's export licence.\\nThis, in our opinion, shows nothing.\\nThe ordinary rule in FOB contracts is that it is the duty of the buyer to obtain the necessary export licence.\\nThat was laid down in Brandt 's case (1) and though in a later case in Hardy vs Pound (2) the Court of Appeal in England held that the judgment in Brandt 's case (1) does not cover every FOB contract and that in the special facts of the particular case before them it was for the sellers to obtain the licence and this view was approved by the House of Lords , it is in our opinion correct to state that the presumption in FOB contracts is that it is the duty of the buyers to obtain export licence, though in the circumstances of a particular case this duty may fall on the sellers.\\nThe third circumstance on which reliance is placed on behalf of the Sales Tax Officer is that the Export Control Order, 1954, which was passed in the exercise of powers conferred by Import & Export Control Act, 1947, contained a provision in its clause 5(2) in these words: \\\" It shall be deemed to be a condition of that licence. . . that the goods for the export of which licence is granted shall be the property of the licensee at the time of the export \\\".\\nIt has been strenuously contended by the learned Solicitor General that it will be reasonable to think that the parties to the contract intended to comply with this condition and to agree as between themselves that the goods shall be the property of the licensee, that is, the buyer, at the time of the export.\\nIt is argued that the time of the export should be interpreted as the time when the customs frontier is crossed and that we must proceed on the basis that the buyer and the sellers intended that the goods shall be the buyer 's property at the point of time when they crossed this frontier.\\nWe see however no justification for thinking that in this clause \\\"the time of the export \\\" means the time (1) (2) 930 when the goods cross the customs frontier.\\nExport has been defined in the Import & Export (Control) Act, 1947, as \\\" taking out of India by sea, land or air \\\".\\nIn the Exports (Control) Order, 1954, the word must be taken to have the same meaning as in the Act.\\nOn that definition the time of the export is the time when the goods go out of the territorial limits of India.\\nThese territorial limits would include the territorial waters of India.\\nConsequently the time of the export is when the ship with the goods goes be yond the territorial limits.\\nAt any rate, the export of the goods cannot be considered to have commenced before the ship carrying goods leaves the port.\\nThe intention of the parties that in compliance with the requirements of cl.\\n5(2) of the Exports (Control) Order the goods shall be the property of the licensee at the time of the export would therefore mean nothing more than that the property in the goods shall pass immediately before the ship goes beyond the territorial waters of the country, or at the earliest when the ship leaves the port.\\nWhichever view is taken there is nothing to indicate that the intention to comply with the requirements of el.\\n5(2) of the Exports (Control) Order carries with it an intention that the property should pass to the buyer at the time the goods cross the customs frontier.\\nIt is true that in the United Motor '8 Case (1) and in other cases it has been held by this Court that the course of export commences to run when the goods cross the customs barrier.\\nWhat the court had to consider in these cases was not however when export commences within the meaning of the Exports (Control) Order but when the course of export commences for the purpose of article 286(1)(b) of the Constitution.\\nFor the reasons which need not be detailed here it was decided that the course of export commences at the time when the goods cross the customs barrier.\\nThese decisions as regards the commencement of the course of export are of no assistance in deciding about the point of time when the export proper commences.\\nAs we have already pointed out when export has been defined in the Import & Export (1) (1953) 4 S.T.C. 133. 931 (Control) Act, 1947, as \\\"taking out of India by land, sea, or air \\\", export in the Export Control Order, cannot be held to have commenced till at least the ship carrying the goods has left the port, though it may in some contexts be more correct to say that it does not commence till the ship has passed beyond the territorial waters.\\nWe have therefore come to the conclusion that there is no circumstance which would justify a conclusion that the parties came to a special agreement that though the sales were on FOB contracts property in the goods would pass to the buyer at some point of time before shipment.\\nWe think that the learned judges who heard the appeal in the Bombay High Court were right in their conclusion that the goods remained the sellers ' property till the goods had been brought and loaded on board the ship and so the sales were exempted from tax under article 286(1)(b) of the Constitution.\\nIn Civil Appeal No. 46 of 1959 the appellants ' contention is that on a correct interpretation of the provisions of section 10(b) of the Bombay Sales Tax Act no purchase tax was leviable from them.\\nSection 10(b) provides for the levy of a purchase tax on the turnover of purchase of goods specified in column I of Schedule B, at the rates, if any, specified against such goods in column 4 of the said schedule, \\\"where a certificate under cl.\\n(b) of section 8 has been furnished in respect of such goods and the purchasing dealer does not show to the satisfaction of the Collector that the goods have been despatched by him or by a person to whom he has sold the goods to an address outside the State of Bombay within a period of six months from the date of purchase by the dealer furnishing such certificate \\\".\\nSection 8(b) provides for the deduction from the turnover, of sale of goods to a dealer who holds an authorisation and furnishes to the selling dealer a certificate in the prescribed form declaring inter alia that the goods so sold to him are intended for being despatched by him or by registered dealers to whom he sells the goods to an address outside the State of Bombay.\\nAdmittedly such a certificate was furnished by 932 M/s. Daulatram Rameshwarlal in respect of the castor oil which they sold to others and that in respect of these sales to them their sellers were allowed deductions.\\nIt is equally undisputed that the persons to whom M/s. Daulatram Rameshwarlal sold the goods were sent to an address outside the State of Bombay within a period of six months from the date of purchase by M/s. Daulatram Rameshwarlal.\\nThese persons are however not registered dealers.\\nThe Sales Tax Officer as also the High Court of Bombay has held that the \\\" person to whom he has sold the goods \\\" in section 10(b) means \\\" a registered dealer to whom he has sold the goods \\\".\\nIt is contended before us on behalf of the appellant dealers that the word \\\" a person \\\" is wide enough to include a registered dealer and an unregistered dealer.\\nIt is urged that the use of the word it a person \\\" instead of the words \\\" a registered dealer \\\" is deliberate and that it was the intention of the Legislature to levy purchase tax on a person who has given such certificate under section 8(b) only if the goods were not 'despatched outside the State of Bombay within the prescribed period by anybody.\\nIt is therefore contended that \\\" a person \\\" in section 8(b) should be interpreted to include a registered dealer or anybody else.\\nWe are unable to agree.\\nA close examination of sections 8 and 10 justifies the conclusion that the Legislature was anxious to secure that the declaration as regards intention of the goods being despatched outside the State of Bombay should be carried out by despatch by \\\" a registered dealer \\\" to whom he sells the goods.\\nIf such despatch outside the State of Bombay is by a person to whom the certifying dealer has sold the goods but who is not a registered dealer the certificate has not been complied with.\\nIt will be in our opinion unreasonable to think that though the Legislature insisted that the certificate should declare the goods purchased were intended 11 for being despatched by him or by a registered dealer to whom he sells the goods outside the State of Bombay \\\", the Legislature would be content to accept actual despatch outside the State of Bombay by one who is not a registered dealer as sufficient.\\nMr. Sanyal contended that the certificate 933 has to declare only an intention and that if ultimately the actual despatch is made by some person who is not a registered dealer, it cannot strictly be said that the declaration has not been carried out.\\nIt might very well be that if at the time a declaration of intention is made in the certificate the purchasing dealer had the intention as stated and ultimately he sells to a person who is not a registered dealer for despatch of the goods outside the State of Bombay, the purchasing dealer may not be liable for having made a false declaration \\\".\\nEven though he has not made a false declaration of his intention, the fact remains that the intention declared has not been carried out.\\nThe scheme of the Legislature clearly is that where the intention as declared has not been carried out purchase tax should be levied.\\nTo hold otherwise would be to make the declaration of the intention useless.\\nOur conclusion therefore is that the courts below have rightly interpreted the words \\\" a person \\\" in section 10(b) of the Bombay Sales Tax Act as a \\\" registered dealer \\\" and that the purchasing dealers have rightly been assessed to purchase tax under section 10(b).\\nIn the result, both the appeals are dismissed with costs.\\nAppeals dismissed.\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"dataset_name\",\n

    \"The appellants and the respondents were owners of adjoining collieries and the suit out of which the present appeal arose was one brought by the respondents for certain reliefs on the allegation that the appellants had encroached upon their coal mines and removed coal from the encroached portion and that they came to know of the said encroachment and removal of coal after they had received the letter dated August 18, 1941, from the Inspector of Mines.\\nThe appellant denied the encroachment and pleaded that the suit was barred by limitation inasmuch as the respondents had knowledge of the encroachment in 1932 then there was a survey by the Department of Mines.\\nThe trial judge found on evidence that the proceedings in 1932 had nothing to do with the matter, held that article 48 of the Limitation Act applied to the suit and that the appellants had failed to prove that the respondents had knowledge of the sinking of the quarries and pits in the encroached land and decreed the suit.\\nThe High Court on appeal accepted the finding of the trial court and although it placed the burden of proving knowledge on the part of the respondents beyond the prescribed time on the appellants, nevertheless proceeded on the assumption that the initial burden to prove that they had knowledge of the said encroachment within the period was on the respondents and affirmed the decree of the trial court.\\nHeld, that the burden of proof had not been misplaced.\\nUnder article 48 of the Indian Limitation Act, which prescribes a three years ' limitation from the date of the knowledge, the initial onus is obviously on the plaintiff to prove that date since it would be within his special knowledge.\\nMoreover, under section 3 of the Act, which makes its obligatory on the court to dismiss a suit barred by limitation, even though such a plea is not set up in defence, it is for the plaintiff to establish that the suit is not so barred.\\nLalchand Marwari vs Mahant Rampur

matter of law and pleading and as a matter of adducing evidence and under section 101 of the 493 Act the burden in the former sense is always on the plaintiff and never shifts, but the burden in the

            "This appeal was heard by this Panel on 10 and 11 February 2010. On 14 April 2010, while we were still considering our decision upon it, we were asked to consider applications for permission to appeal in two other cases in which foreign national prisoners had been detained pending their deportation after completing their sentences of imprisonment. Walumba Lumba, a citizen of the Democratic Republic of Congo, sought permission to appeal from a decision of the Court of Appeal [2010] EWCA Civ 111, [2010] 1 WLR 2168, dismissing his appeal from a decision of Collins J [2008] EWHC 2090 (Admin) on his claim for judicial review to refuse him a declaration that his detention by the Secretary of State for the Home Department was unlawful, for a mandatory order for his release and for damages. Mr Lumba together with Kadian Mighty, a citizen of Jamaica, also sought permission to appeal against the Court of Appeals decision dismissing their appeals from a decision of Davis J [2008] EWHC 3166 (Admin) to dismiss their claims for judicial review of the Secretary of States decision to detain them prior to their deportation and for damages for unlawful detention. We decided to give permission to appeal in both cases, and a direction was given that the appeals should be heard by a panel of nine Justices. As there was plainly a close relationship between the issues raised in those cases and this, we decided to withhold delivery of our judgments in this case until after the decision of nine Justices in the cases of Mr Lumba and Mr Mighty had been given. Following the delivery of the judgment of their cases in R (Lumba) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2011] UKSC 12, [2011] 2 WLR 671 on 11 March 2011 the parties were invited to make written submissions in light of that judgment. Having received and considered their submissions, we are now in a position to give our judgment in this case. The appellant is a national of Zimbabwe. He entered the United Kingdom with leave as a visitor and was then given leave to remain for one year as a student. But he overstayed his leave and, following his conviction for several criminal offences, he was sentenced to a period of imprisonment. The Secretary of State decided that he should be deported. On 8 March 2006 he was detained pending the making of a deportation order. He remained in detention for 27 months until 13 June 2008 when he was released on bail by the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal. On 12 November 2007 while still detained he sought judicial review by means of a mandatory order for his immediate release, a declaration that he was unlawfully detained and damages. On 25 January 2008 Munby J granted a declaration that the appellant had been detained unlawfully for various distinct periods amounting to about 19 months and he gave directions for the assessment of damages: [2008] EWHC 98 (Admin). But he declined to make an order for his release. The Secretary of State appealed against the declaration. The appellant appealed against the refusal of an order for his release, but he was later granted bail and that appeal was not proceeded with. On 6 November 2008 the Court of Appeal (Laws, Keene and Longmore LJJ) allowed the Secretary of States appeal, holding that the appellants detention had been lawful throughout. It remitted a new point which had been raised about the legality of the appellants detention during periods when Munby J held that he was lawfully detained for determination by the High Court: [2008] EWCA Civ 1204, [2009] 1 WLR 1527. The appellant now appeals to this court against the decision by the Court of Appeal that he is not entitled to damages for false imprisonment. Anonymity The appellant has been referred to hitherto in these proceedings as SK (Zimbabwe). Mr Tam QC for the respondent invited the court to maintain the order for the appellants anonymity in accordance with the practice for asylum cases recognised by the Court of Appeal. He suggested that references in the appellants application for asylum might expose him to risk if he were to be returned to Zimbabwe. Mr Husain for the appellant on the other hand did not ask for the order to be maintained. He did not suggest that there were any reasons for concern in his case. He said that he adopted a position of neutrality on this issue. There is no doubt that the court has power to make an anonymity order to restrain publication of a person named in its proceedings. In an extreme case, where he or his family are in peril of their lives or safety, this may help to secure his rights under articles 2 and 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights: In re Guardian News and Media Ltd [2010] UKSC 1, [2010] 2 WLR 325, para 26. Those are the rights that are most likely to be relevant if he is seeking asylum. It may also be made to secure that other persons, such as the press, show respect for his private and family life under article 8 of the Convention. But in such cases the persons article 8 rights must be balanced against the article 10 rights of the press and the general public interest in his being identified: In re Guardian News and Media Ltd, para 76. As the decision in that case shows, however, much will depend on the circumstances of each case. It is no longer the case that all asylum seekers as a class are entitled to anonymity in this Court. The making of such an order has to be justified. I am not persuaded that an order for the appellants anonymity is justified in this case. It must be recognised, of course, that lifting the order for his anonymity is not entirely without risk. It is rarely possible to predict with complete confidence what risks a failed asylum seeker\n",

            "BASELINE HUMAN SUMMARY:\n",
            "The issue in this appeal is whether a failure by the Respondent to comply with a procedural requirement in its policy relating to the detention of foreign national prisoners results in their detention being unlawful, so as to allow the detainee to advance a claim in tort for false imprisonment. Shepherd Masimba Kambadzi is a Zimbabwean national. He entered the UK lawfully, but remained here after his leave to remain expired. In 2005, he was convicted of assault and sexual assault, sentenced to one years imprisonment and ordered to be registered as a sex offender for five years. Prior to his being released from prison, the Respondent decided to make a deportation order against the Appellant. Paragraph 2(2) of Schedule 3 to the Immigration Act 1971 (the 1971 Act) gives the Secretary of State the power to detain foreign nationals pending the making of a deportation order and the Appellant was detained under that power on 7 March 2006. On 24 August 2007, a deportation order was made against the Appellant, after which he was detained under paragraph 2(3) of Schedule 3 to the 1971 Act. In all, he was detained for 27 months until 13 June 2008, when he was granted bail. He has not yet been returned to Zimbabwe because of conditions in that country. The common law has recognised limits on the extent of the power to detain under paragraphs 2(2) and (3) of Schedule 3 to the 1971 Act (the Hardial Singh principles, set down in R v Governor of Durham Prison Ex p Hardial Singh [1984] 1 WLR 904). The Respondent had a policy which detailed how the power to detain was to be exercised. It provided, for example, that all reasonable alternatives to detention must be considered before detention was authorised. The policy also provided for detention to be subject to review at regular intervals. It specified the frequency of review and the grade of official which was to carry them out. The policy required the Appellants detention to be reviewed on five occasions during the first month and then monthly thereafter. The Appellants detention was not reviewed in accordance with that policy. By the date of the first instance hearing of this claim, he had been entitled to 22 monthly reviews of the lawfulness of his detention, in addition to the five reviews which should have taken place in the first month. His detention had been reviewed only ten times. Only six of those reviews had been conducted by officials of the required seniority and, of those six, two were flawed by material errors of fact. The substantive requirements for detaining the Appellant were, however, met throughout the period of his detention: had the Respondent carried out the reviews, it could justifiably have decided to continue to detain him. While still detained, the Appellant raised a judicial review, seeking a declaration that he was unlawfully detained and damages. At first instance, Munby J granted a declaration that the Appellant had been unlawfully detained for various periods amounting to about 19 months and gave directions for the assessment of damages, but he declined to order his release. (The Appellant was subsequently granted bail in other proceedings.) The Court of Appeal allowed the Secretary of States appeal and held that the Appellants detention had been lawful throughout. Although the Supreme Court heard the appeal in February 2010, it delayed handing down its judgment so as to be enable a court of nine Justices to consider the case of R (Lumba) v Secrteary of State for the Home Department [2011] UKSC 12. That case also considered the legality of the detention of foreign national prisoners where the Secretary of State has not complied with the terms of the published policy relating to detention. The Supreme Court, by a majority, allows the appeal. Lord Hope gives the leading judgment; Lady Hale and Lord Kerr issue separate concurring judgments. The majority holds that the Appellants detention was unlawful for the periods in respect of which no review was carried out and that he does have a claim in tort for false imprisonment in respect of those periods. The amount of damages is yet to be ascertained, but will be nominal if it is found that the Appellant would have been detained even if his detention had been reviewed as the policy required. Lord Brown gives a dissenting judgment, with which Lord Rodger agrees. The Secretary of State was under a public law duty to adhere to the terms of the policy relating to reviews unless there were good reasons not to: [36], [39], [66]. The majority of the Court holds that the Respondents unlawful failure to review the Appellants detention, as required by the policy, resulted in his detention being unlawful. The court rejects the argument that because the breach of public law related to a procedural requirement, it did not affect the legality of the detention: [69] [73], [85]. Some procedural requirements go to the legality of the detention and some do not: [71]. The policy was sufficiently closely related to the authority to detain to qualify the Secretary of States discretion under the 1971 Act: [51]. The very point of the review was to ensure that the detention was lawful: [73], [86]. The public law error bore directly on the decision to detain the Appellant and therefore satisfied the test adopted by the majority in Lumba for determining when a public law error will result in detention being unlawful: [42], [88]. The Appellants detention was not unlawful, however, where the only defect in the decision to continue detention was that the review had been carried out by an official of the wrong grade: [60]. As the Court also held in Lumba, it was no defence to the claim that there were grounds which justified the Appellants detention: [54], [73], [88]. False imprisonment is a trespass to the person and actionable in itself, without proof of loss or damage: [74]. The result of the reviews which should\n",

            "The issue in this appeal is whether a failure by the Respondent to comply with a procedural requirement in its policy relating to the detention of foreign national prisoners results in their detention being unlawful, so as to allow the detainee to advance a claim in tort for false imprisonment. Shepherd Masimba Kambadzi is a Zimbabwean national. He entered the UK lawfully, but remained here after his leave to remain expired. In 2005, he was convicted of assault and sexual assault, sentenced to one years imprisonment and ordered to be registered as a sex offender for five years. Prior to his being released from prison, the Respondent decided to make a deportation order against the Appellant. Paragraph 2(2) of Schedule 3 to the Immigration Act 1971 (the 1971 Act) gives the Secretary of State the power to detain foreign nationals pending the making of a deportation order and the Appellant was detained under that power on 7 March 2006. On 24 August 2007, a deportation order was made against the Appellant, after which he was detained under paragraph 2(3) of Schedule 3 to the 1971 Act. In all, he was detained for 27 months until 13 June 2008, when he was granted bail. He has not yet been returned to Zimbabwe because of conditions in that country. The common law has recognised limits on the extent of the power to detain under paragraphs 2(2) and (3) of Schedule 3 to the 1971 Act (the Hardial Singh principles, set down in R v Governor of Durham Prison Ex p Hardial Singh [1984] 1 WLR 904). The Respondent had a policy which detailed how the power to detain was to be exercised. It provided, for example, that all reasonable alternatives to detention must be considered before detention was authorised. The policy also provided for detention to be subject to review at regular intervals. It specified the frequency of review and the grade of official which was to carry them out. The policy required the Appellants detention to be reviewed on five occasions during the first month and then monthly thereafter. The Appellants detention was not reviewed in accordance with that policy. By the date of the first instance hearing of this claim, he had been entitled to 22 monthly reviews of the lawfulness of his detention, in addition to the five reviews which should have taken place in the first month. His detention had been reviewed only ten times. Only six of those reviews had been conducted by officials of the required seniority and, of those six, two were flawed by material errors of fact. The substantive requirements for detaining the Appellant were, however, met throughout the period of his detention: had the Respondent carried out the reviews, it could justifiably have decided to continue to detain him. While still detained, the Appellant raised a judicial review, seeking a declaration that he was unlawfully detained and damages. At first instance, Munby J granted a declaration that the Appellant had been unlawfully detained for various periods amounting to about 19 months and gave directions for the assessment of damages, but he declined to order his release. (The Appellant was subsequently granted bail in other proceedings.) The Court of Appeal allowed the Secretary of States appeal and held that the Appellants detention had been lawful throughout. Although the Supreme Court heard the appeal in February 2010, it delayed handing down its judgment so as to be enable a court of nine Justices to consider the case of R (Lumba) v Secrteary of State for the Home Department [2011] UKSC 12. That case also considered the legality of the detention of foreign national prisoners where the Secretary of State has not complied with the terms of the published policy relating to detention. The Supreme Court, by a majority, allows the appeal. Lord Hope gives the leading judgment; Lady Hale and Lord Kerr issue separate concurring judgments. The majority holds that the Appellants detention was unlawful for the periods in respect of which no review was carried out and that he does have a claim in tort for false imprisonment in respect of those periods. The amount of damages is yet to be ascertained, but will be nominal if it is found that the Appellant would have been detained even if his detention had been reviewed as the policy required. Lord Brown gives a dissenting judgment, with which Lord Rodger agrees. The Secretary of State was under a public law duty to adhere to the terms of the policy relating to reviews unless there were good reasons not to: [36], [39], [66]. The majority of the Court holds that the Respondents unlawful failure to review the Appellants detention, as required by the policy, resulted in his detention being unlawful. The court rejects the argument that because the breach of public law related to a procedural requirement, it did not affect the legality of the detention: [69] [73], [85]. Some procedural requirements go to the legality of the detention and some do not: [71]. The policy was sufficiently closely related to the authority to detain to qualify the Secretary of States discretion under the 1971 Act: [51]. The very point of the review was to ensure that the detention was lawful: [73], [86]. The public law error bore directly on the decision to detain the Appellant and therefore satisfied the test adopted by the majority in Lumba for determining when a public law error will result in detention being unlawful: [42], [88]. The Appellants detention was not unlawful, however, where the only defect in the decision to continue detention was that the review had been carried out by an official of the wrong grade: [60]. As the Court also held in Lumba, it was no defence to the claim that there were grounds which justified the Appellants detention: [54], [73], [88]. False imprisonment is a trespass to the person and actionable in itself, without proof of loss or damage: [74]. The result of the reviews which should\n",

Walumba Lumba, a citizen of the Democratic Republic of Congo, sought permission to appeal from a decision of the Court of Appeal [2010] EWCA Civ 111, [2010] 1 WLR 2168, dismissing his appeal from a decision of Collins J [2008] EWHC 2090 (Admin) on his claim for judicial review to refuse him a declaration that his detention by the Secretary of State for the Home Department was unlawful, for a mandatory order for his release and for damages for unlawful detention. Mr Lumba together with Kadian Mighty, a citizen of Jamaica, also sought permission to appeal against the Court of Appeal decision dismissing their appeals from a decision of Davis J [2008] EWHC 2090 (Admin) on his claim for judicial review to refuse him a declaration that his detention by the Secretary of State for the Home Department was unlawful, for a mandatory order for his release and for damages for unlawful detention.

proceeded with.\\nOn 6 November 2008 the Court of Appeal (Laws, Keene and Longmore LJJ) allowed the Secretary of States appeal, holding that the appellants detention had been lawful throughout.\\nIt remitted a new point which had been raised about the legality of the appellants detention during periods when Munby J held that he was lawfully detained for determination by the High Court: [2008] EWCA Civ 1204, [2009] 1 WLR 1527.\\nThe appellant now appeals to this court against the decision by the Court of Appeal that he is not entitled to damages for false imprisonment.\\nAnonymity\\nThe appellant has been referred to hitherto in these proceedings as SK (Zimbabwe).\\nMr Tam QC for the respondent invited the court to maintain the order for the appellants anonymity in accordance with the practice for asylum cases recognised by the Court of Appeal.\\nHe suggested that references in the appellants application for asylum might expose him to risk if he were to be returned to Zimbabwe.\\nMr Husain for the appellant on the other hand did not ask for the order to be maintained.\\nHe did not suggest that there were any reasons for concern in his case.\\nHe said that he adopted a position of neutrality on this issue.\\nThere is no doubt that the court has power to make an anonymity order to restrain publication of a person named in its proceedings.\\nIn an extreme case, where he or his family are in peril of their lives or safety, this may help to secure his rights under articles 2 and 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights: In re Guardian News and Media Ltd [2010] UKSC 1, [2010] 2 WLR 325, para 26.\\nThose are the rights that are most likely to be relevant if he is seeking asylum.\\nIt may also be made to secure that other persons, such as the press, show respect for his private and family life under article 8 of the Convention.\\nBut in such cases the persons article 8 rights must be balanced against the article 10 rights of the press and the general public interest in his being identified: In re Guardian News and Media Ltd, para 76.\\nAs the decision in that case shows, however, much will depend on the circumstances of each case.\\nIt is no longer the case that all asylum seekers as a class are entitled to anonymity in this Court.\\nThe making of such an order has to be justified.\\nI am not persuaded that an order for the appellants anonymity is justified in this case.\\nIt must be recognised, of course, that lifting the order for his anonymity is not entirely without risk.\\nIt is rarely possible to predict with complete confidence what risks a failed asylum seeker will face when he is returned to his home country.\\nBut the position that the asylum seeker himself adopts will always be an important factor.\\nHe is likely to be in the best position to assess the risks and to say whether or not he needs anonymity for his protection.\\nHis counsel, Mr Husain, is very experienced in these matters and well able to form a sound judgment as to whether this is necessary or desirable.\\nI would have expected him to inform the court if there were any grounds at all for wishing to preserve the appellants anonymity.\\nHad he done so I would, of course, have given a good deal of weight to his submissions.\\nAs it is, in view of the position that he has adopted on the appellants behalf, I am not persuaded that there is anything to prevent his being identified in this case.\\nI would set aside the anonymity order, and name the appellant as Shepherd Masimba Kambadzi.\\nThe appellants case\\nThe context for the appellants claim of damages for false imprisonment is provided by the provisions for the regulation of entry and stay in the United Kingdom which are set out in Part 1 of the Immigration Act 1971, as amended.\\nHis case, put very simply, is that the discretionary power to detain that is vested in the Secretary of State by paragraphs 2(2) and (3) of Schedule 3 to the 1971 Act was not exercised throughout his period of detention in the way it should have been according to the published policy, that for periods when his detention was not reviewed in accordance with the policy it was not authorised and that he is entitled to damages for false imprisonment because his continued detention was unlawful during those periods.\\nA description of the statutory background and the system which, according to his own policy, the Secretary of State had undertaken to operate provides the starting point for an examination of this argument.\\nThe facts of this case are best understood in the light of that background.\\nThe statutory background\\nSection 4 of the 1971 Act provides that the power to give or refuse leave to enter the United Kingdom shall be exercised by immigration officers and that the power to give leave to remain in the United Kingdom, or to vary any leave, shall be exercised by the Secretary of State.\\nSection 3(5) renders a person who is not a British citizen liable to deportation if the Secretary of State deems his deportation to be conducive to the public good.\\nSection 4 gives effect to Schedule 2, paragraph 1(3) of which provides: In the exercise of their functions under this Act immigration officers shall act in accordance with such instructions (not inconsistent with the immigration rules) as may be given them by the Secretary of State.\\nSection 5(3) of the 1971 Act gives effect to Schedule 3 with respect to the removal from the United Kingdom of persons against whom deportation orders are in force and the detention and control of persons in connection with deportation.\\nParagraph 2 of Schedule 3 appears under the heading Detention or control pending deportation.\\nIt provides in subparagraphs (2) and (3): (2) Where notice has been given to a person in accordance with regulations under section 105 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (notice of decision) of a decision to make a deportation order against him, and he is not a detained person in pursuance of the sentence or order of a court, he may be detained under the authority of the Secretary of State pending the making of the deportation order. (3) Where a deportation order is in force against any person, he may be detained under the authority of the Secretary of State pending his removal or departure from the United Kingdom and if already detained by virtue of sub paragraph (1) or (2) above when the order is made, shall continue to be detained unless he is released on bail or the Secretary of State directs otherwise. [emphasis added]\\nAt first sight, the effect of paragraph 2(3) of the Schedule is that, once notice has been given of a decision to make a deportation order against him, the person may lawfully be detained until he is removed or departs.\\nBut, as Munby J observed in para 9 of his judgment, the powers conferred by those paragraphs are not unfettered.\\nIn R v Governor of Durham Prison, Ex p Hardial Singh [1984] 1 WLR 704, 706 Woolf J said: Although the power which is given to the Secretary of State in paragraph 2 to detain individuals is not subject to any express limitation of time, I am quite satisfied that it is subject to limitations.\\nFirst of all, it can only authorise detention if the individual is being detained pending his removal.\\nIt cannot be used for any other purpose.\\nSecondly, as the power is given in order to enable the machinery of deportation to be carried out, I regard the power of detention as being impliedly limited to a period which is reasonably necessary for that purpose.\\nThe period which is reasonable will depend upon the circumstances of the particular case.\\nWhat is more, if there is a situation where it is apparent to the Secretary of State that he is not going to be able to operate the machinery provided in the Act for removing persons who are intended to be deported within a reasonable period, it seems to me that it would be wrong for the Secretary of State to exercise his power of detention.\\nIn addition, I would regard it as implicit that the Secretary of State should exercise all reasonable expedition to ensure that the steps are taken which will be necessary to ensure the removal of the individual within a reasonable time.\\nThis statement was referred to with approval in Tan Te Lam v Superintendent of Tai A Chau Detention Centre [1997] AC 97.\\nLord Browne Wilkinson said of the power to detain pending removal in the Hong Kong Ordinance at p 111A D: Their Lordships have no doubt that in conferring such a power to interfere with individual liberty, the legislature intended that such power could only be exercised reasonably and that accordingly it was implicitly so limited.\\nThe principles enunciated by Woolf J in the Hardial Singh case [1984] 1 WLR 704 are statements of the limitations on a statutory power of detention pending removal.\\nIn the absence of contrary indications in the statute which confers the power to detain pending removal their Lordships agree with the principles stated by Woolf J.\\nIn A v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2004] UKHL 56, [2005] 2 AC 68, para 8 Lord Bingham of Cornhill said that Woolf Js guidance in Hardial Singh had never been questioned.\\nIn R (I) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2002] EWCA Civ 888, [2003] INLR 196, para 46, Dyson LJ said that counsel had correctly submitted that the following four principles (the Hardial Singh principles) emerge from it: (i) The Secretary of State must intend to deport the person and can only use the power to detain for that purpose; (ii) The deportee may only be detained for a period that is reasonable in all the circumstances; (iii) If, before the expiry of the reasonable period, it becomes apparent that the Secretary of State will not be able to effect deportation within that reasonable period, he should not seek to exercise the power of detention; (iv) The Secretary of State should act with reasonable diligence and expedition to effect removal.\\nIt was common ground in R (Lumba) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2011] 2 WLR 671 that in this passage the effect of Woolf Js judgment was correctly summarised and it was approved as an accurate statement of the relevant principles: see, eg, paras 171 174.\\nAs Lady Hale said at para 199, the detention must be for the statutory purposes of making or implementing a deportation order and for no other purpose.\\nThe cases were reviewed by Lord Brown of Eaton under Heywood in R (Khadir) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2005] UKHL 39, [2006] 1 AC 207, where the power to detain was exercised under Schedule 2 in the context of removing those refused leave to enter.\\nLord Brown said that, while it went without saying that the longer the delay in effecting someones removal the more difficult it becomes to justify the continued detention meanwhile, that was by no means to say that he does not remain liable to detention: para 31.\\nIn para 33 he said: To my mind the Hardial Singh line of cases says everything about the exercise of the power to detain (when it properly can be exercised and when it cannot); nothing about its existence.\\nThis case is about the way in which the power to detain can properly be exercised, but it raises issues about the existence of the power too.\\nDoes the Secretary of States failure to comply with his published policy for regular reviews to monitor changing circumstances deprive him of his executive power to continue to detain the detainee? Or does his power continue until a review shows that continued detention is no longer appropriate? I think that an examination of the Hardial Singh principles may help to resolve these questions, as they give rise to the need for these reviews.\\nBut it is clear that the appellant cannot succeed in his claim by relying solely on those principles.\\nMr Husain for the appellant submits that, while the Secretary of States decision to detain was lawful at its inception, it could become unlawful with the passage of time.\\nThere was no challenge to the judges findings that throughout the period that the appellant was detained the Hardial Singh principles were complied with.\\nIn the Court of Appeal Laws LJ said that the judge was entitled to be so satisfied: [2009] 1 WLR 1527, para 36.\\nBut Mr Husains case is that the matter does not rest there.\\nHe says that the Secretary of States published policy also regulates the existence of the power to continue detention, and that it must be followed in the absence of good reason not to do so.\\nThe published policy\\nBefore I come to the published policy I should mention that the Secretary of State was given power by the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 to make rules for the regulation and management of detention centres.\\nRule 9 of the Detention Centre Rules 2001 (SI 2001/238) provides: (1) Every detained person will be provided, by the Secretary of State, with written reasons for his detention at the time of his initial decision, and thereafter monthly. (2) The Secretary of State shall, within a reasonable time following any request to do so by a detained person, provide that person with an update on the progress of any relevant matter relating to him.\\nRule 9(3) sets out a list of relevant matters for the purposes of that paragraph.\\nIn the Court of Appeal, para 45, Keene LJ said that it was clearly implicit in the rule that the Secretary of State has to reconsider the justification for detention, month by month, in the light of changing circumstances.\\nAt para 46 he said: The need for such regular reviews stems from the necessity for the Secretary of State to monitor changing circumstances in a given case lest his power to detain, on the principles set out in Ex p Hardial Singh [1984] 1 WLR 704, no longer exists.\\nEven if the power still exists, he has a discretion to exercise which he must also keep under review.\\nThe importance of the detainee receiving regular statements of the reason why he is still detained is self evident: he needs to be in a position to know whether he can properly challenge the Secretary of States decision in the courts by way of an application for habeas corpus or judicial review or whether he can apply for bail on a meaningful basis.\\nSo the requirements imposed by rule 9 cannot be treated lightly, especially when one is dealing with administrative detention which deprives a person of his liberty without a court order.\\nI agree with these observations, but I would prefer to apply them to the system of review that is set out in the policy rather than to the system required by rule 9(1).\\nThis is because it seems to me that the 2001 Rules are concerned with the regulation and management of detention centres, not with the way the discretion to detain is exercised.\\nThis is what the explanatory note says, and I think that Keene LJ was right to conclude in para 47 that rule 9(1) is not concerned with limiting the Secretary of States power to detain.\\nIn any event the appellant was detained in prison conditions to which the Rules do not apply for the first 14 months of the period of his detention.\\nIt was not until April 2007 that he was moved to a detention centre and the Rules applied to his case.\\nI come then to the Secretary of States policy.\\nIt is to be found in a document issued by the Home Office called the Operations Enforcement Manual.\\nVarious versions of this manual have been existence since at least 2001.\\nMr Tam informed the Court that it was safe to proceed on the basis that the version used in these proceedings, which was downloaded in 2007, was the one that was in circulation while the appellant was being held in detention.\\nChapter 38 of the manual is entitled Detention and Temporary Release.\\nIt is here that the published policies regulating the exercise of the Secretary of States discretion, in accordance with the Hardial Singh principles, are set out.\\nParagraph 38.1, headed Policy refers to the 1998 White Paper Fairer, Faster and Firmer: a Modern Approach to Immigration and Asylum (1998) (Cm 4018) in which it was said there was a presumption in favour of temporary admission or release and that detention would most usually be appropriate to effect removal, initially to establish a persons identity or basis of claim or where there is reason to believe that the person will fail to comply with any conditions attached to the grant of temporary admission or release.\\nIt refers also to the 2002 White Paper Secure Borders, Safe Haven: Integration with Diversity in Modern Britain (2002) (Cm 5687) in which the principles stated in the 1998 White Paper were reiterated.\\nThese criteria are said to represent the Governments stated policy on the use of detention.\\nThere then follows this important acknowledgement of the significance of the policy in public law: To be lawful, detention must not only be based on one of the statutory powers and accord with the limitations implied by domestic and Strasbourg case law but must also accord with this stated policy. [emphasis added] Under the sub heading Use of Detention these words appear: In all cases detention must be used sparingly, and for the shortest period necessary.\\nParagraph 38.3 is headed Factors influencing a decision to detain (excluding pre decision fast track cases).\\nIt contains the following instructions: 1.\\nThere is a presumption in favour of temporary admission or temporary release. 2.\\nThere must be strong grounds for believing that a person will not comply with conditions of temporary admission or temporary release for detention to be justified. 3.\\nAll reasonable alternatives to detention must be considered before detention is authorised. 4.\\nOnce detention has been authorised it must be kept under close review to ensure that it continues to be justified. 5.\\nEach case must be considered on its individual merits.\\nVarious factors which must be taken into account when considering the need for initial or continued detention are then set out.\\nThey include, among other things, the likelihood of the person being removed and, if so, after what timescale; whether there is any history of previous absconding or of failure to comply with conditions of temporary release or bail; and whether there is a previous history of complying with the requirements of immigration control.\\nParagraph 38.5 is headed Levels of authority for detention.\\nIt states: Although the power in law to detain an illegal entrant rests with the [immigration officer], or the relevant non warranted immigration caseworker under the authority of the Secretary of State, in practice, an officer of at least [Chief Immigration Officer] rank, or a senior caseworker, must give authority.\\nDetention must then be reviewed at regular intervals (see 38.8).\\nParagraph 38.5.2 states that the decision as to whether a person subject to deportation action should be detained under Immigration Act powers is taken by a senior caseworker in the Criminal Casework Directorate.\\nParagraph 38.6 is headed Detention Forms.\\nThe opening sentence states: The Government stated in the 1998 White Paper that written reasons for detention should be given in all cases at the time of detention and thereafter at monthly intervals. [emphasis in the original] The authority to detain is known as Form IS91.\\nParagraph 38.6.1, which is headed Form IS91RA Risk Assessment, states: Once it has been identified that the person is one who should be detained, consideration should be given as to what, if any, level of risk that person may present whilst in detention. [Immigration officers] should undertake the checks detailed on form IS91RA part A Risk Factors (in advance, as far as possible, in a planned operation/visit when it is anticipated detention will be required.\\nParagraph 38.6.2, which is headed Form IS9I Authority to Detain, states that once the Detainee Escorting and Population Management Unit has decided on the location for detention they will forward a form to the detaining office detailing the detention location and the assessment of risk, which is attached to form IS91 and served on the detaining agent.\\nIf there is an alteration in risk factors a new form IS91 is issued.\\nParagraph 38.8 is headed Detention Reviews.\\nIt is on its provisions that the appellants argument that from time to time during the period of his detention he was detained unlawfully depends.\\nIt identifies the grade of officer by whom initial detention must be authorised.\\nIt then states: Continued detention in all cases of persons in sole detention under Immigration Act powers must be subject to administrative review at regular intervals.\\nAt each review robust and formally documented consideration should be given to the removability of the detainee.\\nA formal and documented review of detention should be made after 24 hours by an Inspector and thereafter, as directed, at the 7, 14, 21 and 28 day points.\\nAt the 14 day stage, or if circumstances change between weekly reviews an Inspector must conduct the review.\\nIn [the Criminal Casework Directorate] an [higher executive officer] reviews detention up to 2 months. [A senior executive officer/Her Majestys inspector] reviews detention up to 4 months, the Assistant Director/Grade 7 up to 8 months, the Deputy Director up to 11 months and the Director up to 12 months and over. [emphasis in the original]\\nThe facts\\nThe appellant arrived in this country on 30 October 2002 as a visitor with six months leave to enter.\\nOn 9 May 2003 he applied for leave to remain for two years as a student.\\nHe was granted leave for one year until 30 April 2004.\\nAfter that date he remained here without leave.\\nOn 9 December 2005 he was convicted on two counts of common assault and one count of sexual assault on a female.\\nHe was sentenced to 12 months imprisonment and ordered to be registered as a sex offender for five years.\\nThe judge did not recommend deportation.\\nBut on 7 March 2006, the day before he was due to be released from prison after serving six months of his sentence including time spent on remand, the Secretary of State decided to make a deportation order against him.\\nHe was detained under paragraph 2(2) of Schedule 3 to the 1971 Act and remained in custody at HMP Woodhill.\\nOn 24 March 2006 the appellant claimed asylum.\\nOn 11 April 2006 he asked the Secretary of State to move him from the prison to a detention centre, but his request was ignored.\\nOn 18 April 2006 the Citizens Advice Bureau wrote two letters to the Secretary of State on his behalf.\\nIn one it requested his urgent transfer to a detention centre.\\nIn the other it appealed against the notice of decision to make a deportation order.\\nOn 20 April 2006 and again on 3 May 2006 the Citizens Advice Bureau wrote to the Secretary of State on the appellants behalf contending that his continued detention was unlawful.\\nMunby J said in para 19(xvi) that these letters were clearly relying upon the Hardial Singh principles, but they went unanswered.\\nOn 17 May 2006 the appellant, who had now been moved to HMP Lincoln, applied for bail.\\nHis application was refused on 19 May 2006.\\nHe applied for bail again on 15 September 2006.\\nOn 19 September 2006 the Secretary of State refused his application for asylum.\\nTwo days later, on 21 September 2006, the Asylum and Immigration Appeals Tribunal heard his appeals against the decision to deport, the refusal of asylum and a refusal to grant him relief on human rights grounds.\\nThe tribunal refused bail, having noted that he had previously committed an offence under the Bail Act 1976.\\nOn 4 October 2006 the Tribunal issued its decision dismissing all three appeals.\\nIt stated that the appellant, believing that he had a poor case in resisting deportation, had sought to bolster his prospects of success by inventing a false claim and that the Secretary of State was right to conclude that his deportation was necessary as the offences which he had committed were serious and he had been assessed as presenting a medium risk of sexual or violent offending upon his release.\\nOn 4 May 2007 he was moved from HMP Lincoln to Campsfield Immigration Removal Centre.\\nOn 6 July 2007, following a hearing for the reconsideration of his appeals that had been ordered in January 2007, the tribunal refused his appeals following reconsideration.\\nOn 24 August 2007 a deportation order was made and served on the appellant.\\nAs the appellant is a national of Zimbabwe, it is to Zimbabwe that the Secretary of State proposes to deport him.\\nBut two years previously on 4 August 2005 Collins J ordered by consent that removal of 30 Zimbabweans be suspended pending resolution of the issue in a test case, and the enforced return of failed Zimbabwean asylum seekers was suspended by the Secretary of State.\\nThe position as at the date of the hearing of this appeal was that no enforced returns of Zimbabwean failed asylum seekers had taken place since that date.\\nBy a letter dated 8 March 2006 the appellant was informed that he was to be detained and that his detention would be reviewed on a regular basis.\\nIf the reviews had been carried out in accordance with the policy set out in paragraph 38.8 of the manual they would have occurred on 10 March 2006 (after 24 hours), 16 March 2006 (7 days), 23 March 2006 (14 days), 30 March 2006 (21 days) and 6 April 2006 (28 days).\\nThey would have been carried out thereafter at monthly intervals.\\nAs to the monthly reviews, the paragraph 38.8 provides that the first two monthly reviews must be carried out by a Higher Executive Officer, the next two by a Senior Executive Officer or one of Her Majestys Inspectors, the next four by an Assistant Director or Grade 7 civil servant, the next three by a Deputy Director and, in the case of the monthly reviews in the second year of detention, by a Director.\\nBy the date of the hearing before Munby J the appellant had been entitled to 22 monthly reviews of the lawfulness of his detention in addition to the initial five reviews in the first month.\\nIn the event he had had only 10 reviews up to the date of the hearing.\\nOf these, only six were conducted by officials of the required seniority.\\nOf these, two were disavowed by the Secretary of State as flawed by material errors of fact.\\nThe details of the Secretary of States failure to carry out reviews at the required frequency and by the appropriate persons are set in the judgment of Munby J at paras 43 51 and 124 127 and in paras 11 13 of the judgment of the Court of Appeal.\\nThe judge described the picture that emerged from his analysis of the Secretary of States file as deeply disturbing and profoundly shocking.\\nThe Secretary of State has acknowledged that reviews should have been carried out.\\nHe has not sought to justify or excuse in any way their absence in the appellants case.\\nHe also accepts that these failures cannot be extenuated by the appellants own bad character or his previous conduct.\\nIt is now known, following disclosures that were made prior to the hearing of R (WL) Congo v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2010] EWCA Civ 111, [2010] 1 WLR 2168 by the Court of Appeal, that from April 2006 to September 2008 the Home Office applied an unpublished detention policy to all foreign national prisoners following the completion of their prison sentences pending their deportation.\\nThis followed the revelation on 25 April 2006 that during the past seven years over 1,000 such prisoners had been released from prison on completion of their sentences without being considered for deportation or deported.\\nIllegal migrants and paedophiles, a toxic mix.\\nThe tabloids will go bananas.\\nThe words of a contemporary diarist, Chris Mullin, Decline and Fall (2010), p 94, capture the atmosphere of disaster that was engendered among ministers by this announcement.\\nA few days later Charles Clarke was removed from his post and was replaced on 4 May 2006 as Home Secretary by Dr John Reid.\\nA practice of blanket detention was then instituted with a ruthless determination that precluded consideration of the merits of any individual case and was wholly at odds with the presumption in the published policy in favour of temporary admission or temporary release.\\nIt remained in place until November 2007 when it was replaced by another unpublished policy which permitted release only in exceptional circumstances.\\nIt was not until 9 September 2008 that a revised detention policy was published.\\nThis course of events may explain the Secretary of States failure to carry out reviews at the required frequency and by the appropriate persons in the appellants case.\\nBut his case has been conducted throughout so far on the basis that the policy that was being applied to him was the published policy.\\nThe new issues that he has raised in light of these disclosures are presently stayed for determination by the High Court: see Laws LJ [2009] 1 WLR 1527, paras 42 44.\\nThe issues\\nMunby J held that the appellant was unlawfully detained for the periods which he specified by reason of the Secretary of States failures to carry out the reviews required by rule 9(1) and the manual.\\nThe basis for that finding is to be found in the following passage in his judgment [2008] EWHC 98 (Admin), para 68: Integral to the scheme endorsed by Parliament in its approval of rule 9(1) of the Detention Centre Rules 2001, and integral to the policy laid down by the Secretary of State in paragraph 38.8 of the Operations Enforcement Manual, is the principle that someone is not to be detained beyond a certain period without there being a review undertaken at regular intervals and moreover, as required by the Secretary of States policy, a review undertaken at increasing high levels of seniority within the Home Office as the period of detention grows.\\nThose reviews are fundamental to the propriety of the continuing detention, they are required in order to ensure that the continuing detention can still be justified in the light of current, and perhaps, changed circumstances, and they are, in my judgment, a necessary prerequisite to the continuing legality of the detention.\\nIn para 122 he said that, to the extent that the appellants detention had been unlawful as a matter of domestic law it had also, by parity of reasoning, been unlawful by virtue of section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998, and that there was nothing in the circumstances of his case to give him a remedy under section 6 where there would not be a remedy under domestic law.\\nSo in practical terms the claim under article 5 of the Convention added nothing.\\nIn the Court of Appeal Laws LJ said that the issue was one of statutory construction: [2009] 1 WLR 1527, para 21.\\nEx p Hardial Singh showed that paragraph 2(2) of Schedule 3 to the 1971 Act was subject to implied limitations.\\nThe question, as he saw it, was whether a further limitation was to be found such that on a proper construction of paragraph 2(2) the power was subject to compliance with the rule and the manual: para 23.\\nSummarising his conclusions, with which the other members of the court agreed, he said that compliance with the rules and the manual as such was not a condition precedent to a lawful decision pursuant to paragraph 2(2): para 25.\\nThe statute did not make it so, nor did the common law or the Convention.\\nThe Hardial Singh principles had to be complied with, but this was subject to control by the courts, principally by way of judicial review.\\nIn that event the particular context would be the vindication of those principles, but in this case it was plain that the appellant was held in compliance with them throughout the period of his detention.\\nMr Husain accepted that the Hardial Singh principles had throughout been complied with.\\nOn the other hand there had been repeated failures to comply with the system of review set out in the manual.\\nParagraph 38.8 of the manual states that continued detention in all cases under Immigration Act powers must be subject to administrative review at regular intervals.\\nThese reviews were essential to the continued legality of the exercise by the Secretary of State of his discretion to detain.\\nHe accepted that not all public law errors or policy defaults will render detention unlawful.\\nThe question will always be whether the error is sufficiently linked to the decision to detain or to continue detention.\\nIn this case the reviews required by the policy must be seen as the authority on which continued legality of the detention rests.\\nHe accepted that if his case were to succeed at common law his case under article 5 would not add anything.\\nBut in case it were necessary to address this argument he submitted that the appellant was entitled to the implied protections prescribed by article 5(1)(f).\\nThere had been a clear breach of national procedural rules because the Secretary of State had failed to comply with the rules and with the published policy, which he was required to follow unless there were good reasons not to do so.\\nThis was irrespective of whether the requirements that had been breached were conditions precedent to the exercise of the power to detain.\\nAs to the effect of the decision in Lumba, Mr Husain submitted that it was now clear that it was not a defence for the Secretary of State to show that the detention complied with the Hardial Singh principles and the requirements of the statute.\\nNor was it a defence for him to show that had the public law error not been committed the detainee would have been detained in any event.\\nThe serial failure to conduct the proper detention reviews was a material public law error, as it was essential to the legality of a temporarily unlimited and otherwise unchecked power to continue detention.\\nThe initial detention authority by the Secretary of States executive order was to be contrasted with orders to detain by a court.\\nThe reviews were an important safeguard.\\nThe failure to conduct them amounted, on the facts of this case, to an abuse of the power to detain.\\nFor the Secretary of State Mr Tam accepted that the Hardial Singh principles imposed implied limits on the exercise of the powers of detention that were set out in the statute.\\nBut he submitted that there was no provision or rule that limited the Secretary of States authority to detain in any other way.\\nThings had not been done, probably in violation of his duty in public law, for which legal remedies might have been available.\\nBut the claim in this case was a very specific one.\\nThe question was not whether there had been a breach of the law.\\nThe appellant was seeking damages for false imprisonment.\\nThere was no basis for such a claim, as the detention was at all times within the original authority to detain under the powers that were to be found in the statute.\\nThat would have been plain from the documents that were available in his case had his continued detention had been challenged by judicial review.\\nIn the light of the judgments in Lumba, the central question for the court was whether each relevant breach of the procedural requirement to review detention was material in public law terms, that is to say whether it bore on and was relevant to the decision to detain.\\nThere was a difference between a requirement that was procedural only and a failure to apply a substantive rule which was capable of affecting the decision to detain or not to detain.\\nA pure omission to review detention at the times specified by the policy was not material, at least in a case such as this where, had the review been carried out, the application of the substantive rules would have resulted in a decision to continue detention.\\nBut he accepted that if that submission was rejected, an omission to make a new decision by way of a detention review which was material in the Lumba sense must inevitably have the effect that the next period of detention was not authorised and the tort of false imprisonment was made out.\\nThe common law remedy\\nThe issue as to whether the appellant is entitled to damages, as focussed by these arguments, is a narrow one.\\nIt is common ground that the appellant was lawfully detained at the outset, as his detention was with a view to the making of a deportation order.\\nThere was a serious breakdown thereafter in the system of reviews mandated by the manual.\\nBut it is also common ground, as the judge found, that the Hardial Singh principles were complied with throughout the entire period.\\nAs Mr Tam points out, the continued detention could at all times have been justified by the Secretary of State had he been faced with an application for judicial review.\\nUntil 24 August 2007, when the deportation order was made and served on the appellant, the appellant was being detained under paragraph 2(2) pending the making of a deportation order.\\nFrom that date onwards he was being detained under paragraph 2(3) because he had not been released on bail and the Secretary of State had not directed otherwise.\\nOn the other hand Mr Tam accepts that the breakdown in the system was a breach of a duty owed by the Secretary of State to the appellant in public law.\\nThe appellant could have obtained a mandatory order at any time requiring the reviews to be carried out if he had asked for this.\\nThe focus of attention therefore is on the authority to detain.\\nIs the review essential to the legality of the continued detention? Or is it a sufficient answer to the claim for damages for the Secretary of State to say that, unless and until he directed otherwise, the authority to detain is there throughout in terms of the statute? I have not found this an easy question to answer.\\nI do not accept the Court of Appeals view that the question is one of statutory construction.\\nWe are dealing in this case with what the Secretary of State agrees are public law duties which are not set out in the statute.\\nOf course it is for the courts, not the Secretary of State, to say what the effect of the statements in the manual actually is.\\nBut there is a substantial body of authority to the effect that under domestic public law the Secretary of State is generally obliged to follow his published detention policy.\\nIn R (Saadi) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2001] EWCA Civ 1512, [2002] 1 WLR 356, para 7, Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers MR, delivering the judgment of the court, said that lawful exercise of statutory powers can be restricted, according to established principles of public law, by government policy and the legitimate expectation to which such policy gives rise.\\nIn Nadarajah v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2003] EWCA Civ 1768, [2004] INLR 139, para 54 the Master of the Rolls, again delivering the judgment of the court, said: Our domestic law comprehends both the provisions of Schedule 2 to the Immigration Act 1971 and the Secretary of States published policy, which, under principles of public law, he is obliged to follow.\\nIn D v Home Office (Bail for Immigration Detainees intervening) [2005] EWCA Civ 38, [2006] 1 WLR 1003, para 132 Brooke LJ said that what the law requires is that the policies for administrative detention are published and that immigration officers do not stray outside the four corners of those policies when taking decisions in individual cases.\\nWade and Forsyth, Administrative Law 10th ed, (2009), pp 315 316 states that the principle that policy must be consistently applied is not in doubt and that the courts now expect government departments to honour their statements of policy.\\nPolicy is not law, so it may be departed from if a good reason can be shown.\\nBut it has not been suggested that there was a good reason for the failure of officials of the required seniority to review the detention in this case and to do so in accordance with the prescribed timetable.\\nMr Husain submitted that the effect of the statements in the manual was not just to create a legitimate expectation that the reviews would be carried out.\\nHe said that, as the discretion to detain under the statute had to be exercised reasonably according to the Hardial Singh principles, the authority for continued detention was dependent on decisions taken each time it was reviewed.\\nMoreover an unlawful detention was not rendered lawful because there were circumstances that might have made it lawful.\\nHe sought support for that proposition in Clarke LJs observation in Roberts v Chief Constable of the Cheshire Constabulary [1999] 1 WLR 662, 666, that the detention in that case was unlawful because it was not reviewed until some event occurred to make it lawful.\\nBut that was a case where the plaintiff was detained under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, section 34(1) of which provided that a person arrested for an offence shall not be kept in detention except in accordance with the provisions of Part IV of the Act.\\nSection 40, which was in Part IV, required reviews of the detention of person police custody at stated intervals.\\nIt was clear, as Clarke LJ said in the passage at p 666 that Mr Husain referred to, that the plaintiff was not being detained in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Act.\\nAs Mr Husain pointed out, the Secretary of State accepts that where the authorising statute provides that a particular procedural step is a precondition to the legality of the detention a failure to carry out the required step means that the detention is unlawful and entitles the detainee to damages for false imprisonment.\\nThat is what was decided in Roberts v Chief Constable of the Cheshire Constabulary [1999] 1 WLR 662.\\nBut that case, as Mr Tam put it, was all about the statute.\\nThe situation in this case is quite different, as there is no mention of the need for reviews in relevant paragraphs in the authorising statute.\\nI agree with both Laws LJ in the Court of Appeal, para 25, and Lord Brown (see para 100, below), that Roberts provides little, if any, assistance on the effect of the Secretary of States failure to comply with his published policy.\\nOn the other hand the appellants argument that where the published policy is departed from the detention is unlawful finds some support in Nadarajah v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2004] INLR 139.\\nTwo appeals were before the court in that case.\\nThe appellants had both been detained on the ground that their removal from the United Kingdom was imminent.\\nThe Secretary of States published policy was not to treat removal as imminent once proceedings which challenged the right to remove had been initiated.\\nIt was also the policy of the immigration service when considering the imminence of removal to disregard information from those acting for asylum seekers that proceedings were about to be initiated.\\nBut this policy had not been made public and it was held that the Secretary of State could not rely on it.\\nIn para 54 the Master of the Rolls, Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers, said that he was obliged to follow his published policy.\\nAsking itself the question whether the appellants detention had been lawful, the court held that it was not.\\nIn para 68, referring to Nadarajahs case, Lord Phillips said: The only basis upon which the Immigration Service could treat his removal as imminent was by applying that aspect of the Secretary of States policy which had not been made public, namely that no regard would be paid to an intimation that judicial review proceedings would be instituted.\\nThe Secretary of State cannot rely upon this aspect of his policy as rendering lawful that which was, on the face of it, at odds with his policy, as made public.\\nIn other words, it was unlawful for him to depart from his published policy unless there were good reasons for doing so.\\nIn para 72, referring to the case of the other appellant, he said that his detention was unlawful for the same reason as Nadarajahs detention was unlawful.\\nIn consequence of that decision he was entitled to damages: see para 15.\\nIn Mohammed Holgate v Duke [1984] AC 437, 443, Lord Diplock said that the Wednesbury principles are applicable not only in proceedings for judicial review but also for the purpose of founding a cause of action at common law for trespass by false imprisonment.\\nIt may be that not every public law error will justify resort to the common law remedy in every case.\\nBut I do not think that it is necessary to show that there was bad faith or that the discretion was exercised for an improper purpose in the present context.\\nWhere there is an executive discretion to detain someone without limit of time, the right to liberty demands that the cause of action should be available if the discretion has not been lawfully exercised.\\nIn R v Deputy Governor of Parkhurst Prison, Ex p Hague [1992] 1 AC 58 Lord Bridge of Harwich said that the tort of false imprisonment has two ingredients: the fact of imprisonment and the absence of lawful authority to justify it.\\nThe requirements of the 1971 Act and Hardial Singh principles are not the only applicable law with which the Secretary of State must comply.\\nNadarajahs case shows that lawful authority for an executive power of detention may also be absent when there is a departure from the executives published policy.\\nAs Lord Brown points out, the published policy in Nadarajahs case entitled the detainee to release because it narrowed the grounds on which the power of detention was exercisable: para 107, below.\\nIn this case the policy was different because it was concerned not with the grounds for detention but with procedure.\\nAll it did was to provide that the detention would be reviewed by designated officers at regular intervals.\\nOf course I agree with him that the policies are different.\\nBut I do not think that this difference means that Nadarajah offers no assistance in this case.\\nOn the contrary, it seems to me to indicate that a failure by the executive to adhere to its published policy without good reason can amount to an abuse of power which renders the detention itself unlawful.\\nI use this expression to describe a breach of public law which bears directly on the discretionary power that the executive is purporting to exercise.\\nThe importance of the principle that the executive must act within the law was emphasised by Lord Bingham in his seminal Sir David Williams lecture, The Rule of Law [2007] CLJ 67, 72, when he said: The broader and more loosely textured a discretion is, whether conferred on an official or a judge, the greater the scope for subjectivity and hence for arbitrariness, which is the antithesis of the rule of law.\\nThis sub rule requires that a discretion should ordinarily be narrowly defined and its exercise capable of reasoned justification.\\nThat is a proposition which can be applied to this case.\\nThe published policy narrowed the power of executive detention by requiring that it be reviewed regularly.\\nThis was necessary to meet the objection that, unless it was implemented in accordance with a published policy, the power of executive detention was being applied in a manner that was arbitrary.\\nSo it was an abuse of the power for the detainee to be detained without his detention being reviewed at regular intervals.\\nApplying the test proposed by Lord Dyson in Lumba, it was an error which bore on and was relevant to the decision to detain throughout the period when the reviews should have been carried out: [2011] 2 WLR 671, para 68.\\nThe authorities relied on by the Secretary of State\\nMr Tam referred to a series of cases where detention was held not to be unlawful despite errors of public law.\\nIn R v Deputy Governor of Parkhurst Prison, Ex p Hague [1992] 1 AC 58 the appellant Hague had been segregated under a procedure which was not lawful which it was claimed amounted to false imprisonment, and another prisoner named Weldon claimed that he had been falsely imprisoned and battered by certain prison officers.\\nThose claims were rejected, in short because the sentence of imprisonment provided lawful authority for the prisoners detention, that this could not be read as subject to any implied term with respect to the prison rules and that an otherwise lawful detention was not rendered unlawful by the conditions of detention.\\nMr Tam said that it was authority for the view that a public law error made in relation to a persons detention may entitle the person to seek judicial review but does not necessarily give rise to a remedy in damages.\\nI would not quarrel with that proposition, but it begs the question whether the present case is one where a remedy in damages is available.\\nCullen v Chief Constable of the Royal Ulster Constabulary [2003] UKHL 39, [2003] 1 WLR 1763 was a case about the right of access to a solicitor.\\nThe appellant was arrested under section 14(1)(b) of the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act 1982.\\nHe asked to see a solicitor but his right to do so was deferred while he was in police custody.\\nIn contravention of the relevant statute the deferral was made before the appellant requested access and he was not given the reasons for delaying access.\\nHe claimed damages for false imprisonment.\\nLord Hutton said in para 48 that he saw no substance in this submission as he had been lawfully arrested and after his arrest was lawfully detained under the provisions of the statute.\\nThe premature authorisation and the breach of the requirement for reasons to be given did not render the detention unlawful.\\nLord Millett said in para 61 that compliance was not a condition of lawful detention.\\nThis decision indicates that the critical question is likely to be whether breaches of this kind undermine the lawful authority for the detention.\\nOn the view that was taken of the statute that applied in that case, they did not.\\nThe facts of this case, which concerns the Secretary of States discretion to maintain detention in accordance with his published policy, are quite different.\\nIn R (Saadi) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2002] UKHL 41, [2002] 1 WLR 3131, which was concerned with the lawfulness of detention under paragraphs 2(1) and 16(1) of Schedule 2 to the 1971 Act, Lord Slynn of Hadley said at para 48 that the Secretary of States giving of no or wrong reasons did not affect the legality of the detention.\\nMr Tam said that no hint was given in that case that this failure gave rise to a problem as to its legality.\\nBut Collins J said that it was not argued in that case that the muddle about reasons rendered the decision to detain unlawful: [2001] EWCA Civ 1512, [2002] 1 WLR 356, para 16.\\nNor was the effect of a failure to review in issue.\\nIn R (Munjaz) v Mersey Care NHS Trust [2003] EWCA Civ 1036, [2004] QB 395 two psychiatric patients challenged the lawfulness of the policy on seclusion that was applied in their respective hospitals.\\nReferring to what was decided in R v Deputy Governor of Parkhurst Prison, Ex p Hague [1992] 1 AC 58, Hale LJ said that a person who had been deprived of his liberty in pursuance of a lawful power to detain cannot through the medium of a tort of false imprisonment complain about the conditions in which he is detained, at least by those who are lawfully detaining him: para 49.\\nThere had been a breach of the statutory code of practice, but this did not amount to false imprisonment: para 82.\\nMr Tam said that these observations supported his argument.\\nBut he accepts that Hague, Cullen and Munjaz were not concerned with the question whether the person concerned should be detained at all, but only with the conditions of detention (Hague and Munjaz) or the ancillary matter of legal advice while in detention (Cullen).\\nIt should also be noted that in Munjaz, para 77, Hale LJ said that if an individual decision has been taken unlawfully in public law terms and results in actions which are tortious if taken without lawful excuse, then tortious remedies will be available.\\nThe context is different, of course.\\nAnd the claim for a remedy under the tort of false imprisonment was rejected.\\nBut her observation is entirely consistent with what was said in Nadarajah v Secretary of State for the Home Department: see para 39, above.\\nThe question as to the lawfulness of continued detention was directly in issue in R (Walker) v Secretary of State for Justice (Parole Board intervening) [2009] UKHL 22, [2010] 1 AC 553.\\nThat case arose out of the Secretary of States failure to provide the systems and resources that prisoners serving indeterminate sentences for public protection needed to demonstrate to the Parole Board by the time of the expiry of their tariff periods that it was not longer necessary for the protection of the public for them to remain in detention.\\nThere was a breach of the Secretary of States public law duty to provide these facilities.\\nBut, as I noted in para 5, counsel for the prisoners accepted that they were unable to challenge the legality of the warrant which authorised their continued detention.\\nThat provides the context for the passage in the speech of Lord Brown of Eaton under Heywood in paras 36 and 37 on which Mr Tam relies, where he said: 36.\\nIt is one thing to say as indeed is now undisputed that the Secretary of State was in breach (even systemic breach) of his public law duty to provide such courses as would enable IPP prisoners to demonstrate their safety for release and, to some extent at least, course enabling them to reduce the risk they pose, duties inherent in the legislation (the legislations underlying premise as Laws LJ described it [2008] 1 All ER 138, paras 24, 50); quite another to say that such breach of duty results in detention being unlawful.\\nI respectfully agree with the Court of Appeal that it does not. 37.\\nThe remedy for such breach of public law duty indeed the only remedy, inadequate in certain respects it may be is declaratory relief condemning the Secretary of States failures and indicating that he is obliged to do more Past failures do not sound in\\ndamages\\nIn my own speech in Walker, para 6, I said that in terms of the statute the detention was lawful until the Parole board gave a direction for the prisoners release.\\nThe default position was that until the direction was given the protection of the public required that the prisoner should be confined.\\nI do not think that Lord Browns observations can be applied to the different statutory regime that we are concerned with it this case.\\nI agree with him that Walker is no more helpful to the respondents case than Roberts is to the appellant: para 104, below.\\nFor the same reason I do not think that the decision in Dunn v Parole Board [2008] EWCA Civ 374, [2009] 1 WLR 728, where the Court of Appeal applied the same approach where the Parole Board had failed to conduct a timely review and the appellant remained in detention as authorised by the statute, is of any assistance in this case.\\nDiscussion\\nI cannot find in these authorities anything that requires us to hold that the claim for damages for false imprisonment is untenable or which points conclusively in the other direction.\\nI would start therefore with principle that must lie at the heart of any discussion as to whether a persons detention can be justified.\\nThe liberty of the subject can be interfered with only upon grounds that the court will uphold as lawful: R v Governor of Brockhill Prison, Ex p Evans (No 2) [2001] 2 AC 19, 35; see also Tam Te Lam v Superintendent of Tai A Chau Detention Centre [1997] AC 97, per Lord Browne Wilkinson at p 111B.\\nIn Ex p Evans (No 2), p 42, Lord Hobhouse of Woodborough said: Imprisonment involves the infringement of a legally protected right and therefore must be justified.\\nIf it cannot be lawfully justified, it is no defence for the defendant to say that he believed that he could justify it.\\nWe are dealing in this case with the power of executive detention under the 1971 Act.\\nIt depends on the exercise of a discretion, not on a warrant for detention issued by any court.\\nThat is why the manner of its exercise was so carefully qualified by Woolf J in Hardial Singh.\\nThe power to detain must be exercised reasonably and in a manner which is not arbitrary.\\nIf it is not, the detention cannot be lawfully justified.\\nThe initial decision to detain will be held to be lawful if it is made under the authority of the Secretary of State pending the making of a deportation order.\\nBut it cannot be asserted, in the light of what was said in Hardial Singh, that the initial decision renders continued and indefinite detention lawful until the deportation order is made whatever the circumstances.\\nNor can it be said that it has that effect after the deportation order is made pending the persons removal from the United Kingdom when the person is being detained under paragraph 2(3).\\nThe authority that stems from the initial decision is not unqualified.\\nThe question then is what is to be made of the Secretary of States public law duty to give effect to his published policy.\\nIn my opinion the answer to that question will always be fact sensitive.\\nIn this case we are dealing with an executive act which interferes with personal liberty.\\nSo one must ask whether the published policy is sufficiently closely related to the authority to detain to provide a further qualification of the discretion that he has under the statute.\\nUnlike the 2001 Rules, chapter 38 of the manual is concerned with the lawfulness of the detention.\\nThat is made clear in the opening paragraphs: see para 18, above.\\nIt has been designed to give practical effect to the Hardial Singh principles to meet the requirement that, to be lawful, the measures taken must be transparent and not arbitrary.\\nIt contains a set of instructions with which officials are expected to comply: see Schedule 2 to the 1971 Act, para 1(3).\\nAs I see it, the principles and the instructions in the manual go hand in hand.\\nAs Munby J said in para 68, the reviews are fundamental to the propriety of continued detention.\\nThe instructions are the means by which, in accordance with his published policy, the Secretary of State gives effect to the principles.\\nThey are not only commendable; they are necessary.\\nThe relationship of the review to the exercise of the authority is very close.\\nThey too go hand in hand.\\nIf the system works as it should, authorisation for continued detention is to be found in the decision taken at each review.\\nReferences to the authority to detain in the forms that were issued in the appellants case illustrate this point.\\nForm IS 151F, which is headed Monthly Progress Report to Detainees, concludes at the top of page 3 of 3 with the words Authority to maintain detention given, on which the officers comments are invited and beneath which his decision is recorded.\\nThe discretion to continue detention must, of course, be exercised in accordance with the principles.\\nBut it must also be exercised in accordance with the policy stated in the manual.\\nThe timetable which paragraph 38.8 sets out is an essential part of the process.\\nThese are limitations on the way the discretion may be exercised.\\nFollowing the guidance that Nadarajah v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2004] INLR 139 provides (see paras 39 and 40, above), I would hold that if they are breached without good reason continued detention is unlawful.\\nIn principle it must follow that tortious remedies will be available, including the remedy of damages.\\nThere remains however the question of causation: what if the Secretary of State is able to show that, despite the failure to give effect to the policy, continued detention was nevertheless compatible with the Hardial Singh principles? Is it an answer for the Secretary of State to say that, as he could have authorised continued detention had lawful procedures been followed, no tort was committed? Is there room in such a situation for an award of damages?\\nThese questions are brought into sharp focus in this case.\\nMr Husain accepts that the Secretary of State would have been able to justify the need for the appellants detention under the Hardial Singh principles at all times had he been required to do so.\\nBut in Roberts v Chief Constable of the Cheshire Constabulary [1999] 1 WLR 662, 667, Clarke LJ said that it was nothing to the point to say that the detention would have been lawful if a review had been carried out or that there were grounds which would have justified detention.\\nThe statutory requirement with which he was dealing in that case existed in order to ensure that members of the public were not detained except in certain defined circumstances.\\nIn all other circumstances, he said, every member of the public is entitled to his liberty.\\nI would apply that reasoning to this case.\\nIt is true that the reviews were not required by the statute.\\nBut there was a public law duty to give effect to the provisions about reviews in the manual.\\nIf the reviews were not carried out unless for good reason, which is not suggested in this case continued detention was not authorised by the initial decision to detain.\\nIt is no defence for the Secretary of State to say that there were good grounds for detaining the appellant anyway.\\nUnless the authority to detain was renewed under the powers conferred by the statute he was entitled to his liberty.\\nThe decision in Lumba leads inevitably to this conclusion.\\nAs for the question of damages, the decision on this point in Lumba was that the appellants were entitled to no more than nominal damages as their detention was at all times justifiable.\\nBut this cannot be assumed to be so in every case, and in this case the facts have still to be established.\\nSo I would not foreclose entirely the possibility that the appellant in this case is entitled to more than a purely nominal award.\\nThe public law duty exists for the protection of everyone, from the most undeserving to the most vulnerable.\\nThe detention of children, those suffering from physical or mental illness and those who have been traumatised by torture are perhaps the most obvious examples.\\nParagraph 38.8 states that children are reviewed on a regular basis to ensure that the decision to detain is based on the current circumstances of the case and that detention remains appropriate.\\nThis sentence makes explicit in the case of children what must be taken to be the purpose of the reviews in all cases.\\nThe difference is that the system provides for more frequent reviews in the case of children.\\nIn any event, false imprisonment is a trespass against the person which is actionable without proof of special damage: Murray v Ministry of Defence [1988] 1 WLR 692, 701 702, per Lord Griffiths; Roberts v Chief Constable of the Cheshire Constabulary [1999] 1 WLR 662, 666 669, per Lord Clarke.\\nThere may well be issues as to quantum in cases of that kind.\\nAs Smith LJ said in Iqbal v Prison Officers Association [2009] EWCA Civ 1312, [2010] QB 732, para 83, an award of damages for false imprisonment is based on normal compensatory principles: see also Langley v Liverpool City Council [2005] EWCA Civ 1173, [2006] 1 WLR 375, para 70.\\nIt may be that the conclusion in this case will be that an award of nominal damages is all that is needed to recognise that the appellants fundamental rights have been breached.\\nBut that does not affect the issue of principle.\\nI would hold therefore that the appellant is entitled to the remedy he seeks at common law.\\nThere will, of course, have to be an inquiry as to the quantum of damages if the amount is not agreed.\\nArticle 5\\nThe appellants alternative claim is that he has an enforceable right to compensation under article 5(5) of the Convention.\\nHe maintains that his detention did not satisfy the requirements of article 5(1)(f).\\nIt was not lawful, and it was not in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law.\\nHe relies on what the Grand Chamber said in Saadi v United Kingdom (2008) 47 EHRR 17, para 74, and in A v United Kingdom (2009) 49 EHRR 29; Application No 3455/05, 19 February 2009, para 164 as to what was needed to avoid the detention being branded as arbitrary.\\nThe protections referred to in these passages are, as Mr Husain points out, redolent of the Hardial Singh principles.\\nIt is agreed on both sides that the article 5 claim adds nothing to the claim at common law if that claim succeeds: see R (I) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2003] INLR 196, per Simon Brown LJ at para 8; R (Munjaz) v Mersey Care NHS Trust [2004] 2 QB 395, per Hale LJ at para 70.\\nIndeed there are reasons for thinking that the Hardial Singh principles are in some respects more favourable to detainees than Strasbourg requires, as Lord Brown indicates: see para 94, below; Chahal v United Kingdom (1996) 23 EHRR 413, para 112; Saadi v United Kingdom, para 72.\\nSo, as I would hold that the appellant succeeds on his common law claim, I propose to say no more about this alternative, except to note that article 5(5) gives a right to compensation where there has been a contravention of any of the provisions of the article.\\nThis would have provided the appellant with a remedy if, although there was a breach of the public law duty to conduct reviews, he was not entitled to claim damages at common law for false imprisonment.\\nAs it is, for the reasons I have given, I consider that he is entitled to that remedy and at least to nominal damages.\\nConclusion\\nFor these reasons, and for those given by Lady Hale and Lord Kerr with which I am in full agreement, I would allow the appeal.\\nI would restore the declaration that was made by Munby J that the appellants detention by the Secretary of State was unlawful for the periods stated by him, except for a period of one month beginning on 6 December 2007 when the only defect in the decision to continue detention was that the review was carried out by an official of the wrong grade: see R (Lumba v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2011] 2 WLR 671, para 68 per Lord Dyson.\\nI would also restore his orders as to the assessment, if the parties are not agreed, of the quantum of damages.\\nLADY HALE\\nMr Shepherd Kambadzi may not be a very nice person.\\nHe is certainly not a very good person.\\nHe has overstayed his welcome in this country for many years.\\nHe has abused our hospitality by committing assaults and sexual assault.\\nIt is not surprising that the Home Secretary wishes to deport him.\\nBut in R (Roberts) v Parole Board [2005] UKHL 45, [2005] 2 AC 738, para 84, Lord Steyn quoted the well known remark of Justice Frankfurter in United States v Rabinowitz (1950) 339 US 56, p 69, that It is a fair summary of history to say that the safeguards of liberty have frequently been forged in controversies involving not very nice people.\\nLord Steyn continued: Even the most wicked of men are entitled to justice at the hands of the state.\\nAnd I doubt whether Mr Kambadzi is the most wicked of men.\\nHe had come to the end of the time he was due to serve as a result of his crimes.\\nHe may even have been expecting to be released from prison on 8 March 2006.\\nIf so, it must have come as a cruel shock when he was kept in prison (indeed for many months in the same prison where he had been serving his sentence), because the Home Secretary had decided to make a deportation order against him and at the same time to exercise the power to authorise his detention under paragraph 2(2) of Schedule 3 to the Immigration Act 1971.\\nThis gives the Secretary of State an apparently open ended power to authorise the detention of a person who has been served with a notice of intention to deport pending the making of the deportation order.\\nThe order was in fact made more than a year later, after which Mr Kambadzi was detained under paragraph 2(3) of the Schedule, which again gives an apparently open ended power to authorise detention pending his removal or departure from the United Kingdom.\\nNo court had ordered or authorised or approved this detention.\\nThe trial judge who sentenced Mr Kambadzi for his crimes had not even recommended it.\\nA Government official decided to lock him up, on the face of it until a Government official decided to take the next step.\\nBut no one suggests that paragraph 2 of Schedule 3 gives the Government an unlimited power to authorise a persons indefinite detention without trial.\\nEveryone knows that there are limits.\\nEveryone also knows that if those limits are exceeded, the detention becomes unlawful.\\nEveryone also knows that a person who is unlawfully detained is entitled, not only to be released, but to claim compensation for having been unlawfully detained.\\nThe person responsible for the unlawful detention is liable even if he acted in good faith and without any negligence: see R v Governor of Brockhill Prison, Ex p Evans (No 2) [2001] 2 AC 19 (compare the statutory protection given to those who detain mentally disordered or incapacitated people under the Mental Health Act 1983 or the Mental Capacity Act 2005: see s 139(1) and Schedule A1, para 3 respectively).\\nAll this is Hornbook law.\\nThe only question, therefore, is what the limits are to the Home Secretarys powers.\\nIn particular, are there procedural as well as substantive limits? The substantive limits were established as long ago as 1983, in the powerful extempore judgment of Woolf J in R v Governor of Durham Prison, Ex p Hardial Singh [1984] 1 WLR 704, and approved by the Privy Council in Tan Te Lam v Superintendent of the Tai A Chau Detention Centre [1997] AC 97.\\nThe detention has to be pending the deportation order or the removal, as the case may be, and cannot therefore be imposed for any other purpose.\\nIf it becomes clear that the purpose cannot be carried out, the detention becomes unlawful.\\nIn Tan Te Lam, above, the detention of these particular Vietnamese boat people became unlawful once it was clear that the Vietnamese Government did not regard them as Vietnamese nationals and would not have them back.\\nIt was also held in Hardial Singh that the Secretary of State cannot detain a person for longer than is reasonable in all the circumstances.\\nThis can depend upon the reasons for the delay.\\nThe Secretary of State has to exercise all reasonable expedition to ensure that the steps are taken which will be necessary to ensure the removal of the individual within a reasonable time: Hardial Singh, at p 706F.\\nIf the Secretary of State is dragging his feet, then the period may become unreasonable.\\nBut if the detainee is unjustifiably stringing things out, for example by launching an obviously bogus asylum claim, it will not.\\nIn this case, Munby J held that the Home Secretary did indeed intend to deport Mr Kambadzi and that this was still a possibility.\\nHe had been detained for a very long time (22 months by the time that Munby J decided the case in January 2008).\\nBut for most of that time he had been pursuing a claim for asylum, which was clearly bogus, through all possible appellate routes.\\nThereafter he could not be deported because the Home Secretary had temporarily suspended removals to Zimbabwe.\\nBut there remained some prospect of achieving this.\\nHence the detention was substantively justified in accordance with the Hardial Singh principles.\\nBut Munby J held that the detention had, for much of those 22 months, been unlawful because of the failure of the Secretary of States officials to conduct the regular reviews laid down in his own Operations Enforcement Manual.\\nNo one doubts that the failure to conduct these reviews was unlawful, and that the Secretary of State could have been obliged by judicial review proceedings to comply with his stated policy, unless he had a good reason not to do so in the individual case: see the Court of Appeals judgment in this case at [2009] EWCA Civ 1204, [2009] 1 WLR 1527, para 25.\\nThe issue is whether that unlawful failure has also rendered the detention unlawful.\\nThe Manual seemed to think that it did.\\nIt stated that the purpose of the reviews was to ensure that the detention continued to be justified: see para 38.3.4.\\nFurther than that, it declared, at para 38.1: To be lawful, detention must not only be based on one of the statutory powers and accord with the limitations implied by domestic and Strasbourg case law but must also accord with this stated policy.\\nThe Court of Appeal took the same view in Nadarajah v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2003] EWCA Civ 1768, [2004] INLR 139.\\nAt para 54, Lord Phillips stated that: Our domestic law comprehends both the provisions of Schedule 2 to the Immigration Act 1971 and the Secretary of States published policy, which, under principles of public law, he is obliged to follow.\\nThe failure to follow that published policy rendered the detentions unlawful in that case.\\nThe policy which was in question there related to the considerations that the Secretary of State would take into account in deciding to detain.\\nIt went further than the bare bones of the Hardial Singh principles.\\nNadarajah was a case principally brought under article 5 of the European Convention on Human Rights.\\nThe question, therefore, was whether the detention was lawful in the sense that it complied with the Convention standards of legality.\\nIt is not surprising that the Court held that, to be lawful, a decision to detain had to comply, not only with the statute, but also with the Secretary of States published policy.\\nBut it is also not surprising that the majority of this Court has now held, in R (Lumba and Mighty) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2011] UKSC 12; [2011] 2 WLR 671, that a failure to comply with the Secretary of States published policy may also render detention unlawful for the purpose of the tort of false imprisonment.\\nWhile accepting that not every failure to comply with a published policy will render the detention unlawful, I remain of the view that the breach of public law duty must be material to the decision to detain and not to some other aspect of the detention and it must be capable of affecting the result which is not the same as saying that the result would have been different had there been no breach (see the Lumba case, para 207).\\nThe question remains, however, whether a material breach of a public law duty to conduct regular reviews that is, a procedural obligation has the same consequence as a material breach of a public law duty to detain only if certain criteria are fulfilled.\\nFor the sake of the argument before this Court, we have to assume that the case falls into the former category breach of a procedural obligation even though the co incidence of timing and the evidence of the secret policy which emerged in Lumba might suggest that the real reason why the reviews were not conducted as required by the policy was that they would be a waste of time all these people were going to be detained under the new and secret criteria in any event.\\nBut might there be a distinction between the substantive limitations on the power to detain and the procedural requirements for exercising it?\\nSometimes a statute puts the effect of a failure to follow procedural requirements beyond doubt.\\nThe Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, section 34(1), states that A person . shall not be kept in police detention except in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Act; those provisions require regular reviews; failure to conduct those reviews on time renders detention beyond the time when they should have been conducted unlawful: see Roberts v Chief Constable of the Cheshire Constabulary [1999] 1 WLR 662, CA.\\nSometimes a statute does not say in so many words that failing to comply with one of its procedural requirements will render the resulting detention unlawful, but the courts will construe the statute to mean that it does.\\nAn example is the prohibition in the Mental Health Act 1983, section 11(4)(a), of making an application for compulsory admission to hospital if the patients nearest relative objects: Re S C (Mental Patient: Habeas Corpus) [1996] QB 599, CA.\\nIn these cases, it is irrelevant that the person concerned could have been lawfully detained had the correct procedures been followed.\\nSometimes, however, the court will conclude that the lawfulness of detention does not depend upon the fulfilment of a particular statutory requirement.\\nFor example, in R (D) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2006] EWHC 980 (Admin), it was common ground that failing to comply with the requirement in the (Immigration) Detention Centre Rules 2001 SI 2001/238 that immigration detainees be given a medical examination within 24 hours of arrival did not render the detention unlawful unless the detainees could show that it would have led to their earlier release.\\nIn short, there are some procedural requirements, failure to comply with which renders the detention unlawful irrespective of whether or not the substantive grounds for detention exist, and some procedural requirements, failure to follow which does not have this effect.\\nIf the requirement is laid down in legislation, it will be a matter of statutory construction into which category it falls.\\nA clear distinction can be drawn between a requirement which goes to whether or not a person is detained and a requirement which goes to the conditions under which a person is detained.\\nIf the grounds exist for detaining a person in a mental hospital, for example, and the procedures have been properly followed, it is not unlawful to detain him in conditions of greater security than are in fact required by the nature and degree of his mental disorder.\\nThe same analysis applies to requirements which are imposed, not by statute, but by the common law.\\nThere are some procedural requirements which go to the legality of the detention itself and some which do not.\\nThe common law imposed a requirement that an arrested person be told, at the time, the real reason why he was being arrested.\\nIt did so for the very good reason that the arrested person had to know whether or not he was entitled to resist arrest.\\nMr Leachinsky was told that he was being arrested under the Liverpool Corporation Act 1921, but this Act gave the police officers no power to arrest him without a warrant.\\nThey did have power to arrest him on reasonable suspicion of having committed a felony.\\nBut, as they had not told him this, his detention was unlawful and he was entitled to damages for false imprisonment: see Christie v Leachinsky [1947] AC 573.\\nAs Lord Simonds put it, at p 592, if a man is to be deprived of his freedom he is entitled to know the reason why.\\nIt is not statute, but the common law, indeed the rule of law itself, which imposes upon the Secretary of State the duty to comply with his own stated policy, unless he has a good reason to depart from it in the particular case at the particular time.\\nSome parts of the policy in question are not directly concerned with the justification and procedure for the detention and have more to do with its quality or conditions.\\nBut the whole point of the regular reviews is to ensure that the detention is lawful.\\nThat is not surprising.\\nIt was held in Tan Te Lam, above, that the substantive limits on the power to detain were jurisdictional facts, so the Secretary of State has to be in a position to prove these if need be.\\nHe will not be able to do so unless he has kept the case under review.\\nHe himself has decided how often this needs to be done.\\nUnless and until he changes his mind, the detainees are entitled to hold him to that.\\nJust as Mr Leachinskys detention was unlawful even though there were in fact good grounds for arresting him, the detainees detention is unlawful during the periods when it has not been reviewed in accordance with the policy, irrespective of whether or not the review would have led to their release.\\nIn my view, Munby J was right to hold that the reviews were fundamental to the propriety of the continuing detention and a necessary prerequisite to the continuing legality of the detention: see [2008] EWHC 98 (Admin), para 68.\\nIt follows also, from the decision in Lumba, that the fact if it be a fact that had the requisite reviews been held, the decision would have been the same makes no difference.\\nHowever, the result of any review, had it been held, cannot be irrelevant to the quantum of damages to which the detainee may be entitled.\\nFalse imprisonment is a trespass to the person and therefore actionable per se, without proof of loss or damage.\\nBut that does not affect the principle that the defendant is only liable to pay substantial damages for the loss and damage which his wrongful act has caused.\\nThe amount of compensation to which a person is entitled must be affected by whether he would have suffered the loss and damage had things been done as they should have been done.\\nA differently constituted majority in Lumba has now clearly rejected the view, taken by some members of the Court, that deliberate breaches of constitutional rights might attract a conventional sum in vindicatory damages even if the officials conduct were not so egregious as to attract exemplary or punitive damages.\\nThat view has, of course, to be respected.\\nI have reached these conclusions without reference to the Strasbourg case law under article 5 of the European Convention on Human Rights.\\nI did initially think that article 5 might supply the answer to what, on any view, is not an easy question.\\nArticle 5 lays down an exhaustive list of the circumstances in which a person may be deprived of his liberty.\\nThese include, in article 5(1)(f), the lawful arrest or detention of a person against whom action is being taken with a view to deportation or extradition.\\nThe requirement of lawfulness is not limited to complying with the substantive and procedural provisions of the domestic law.\\nThe Convention itself imports extra requirements in order to ensure that the detention is not arbitrary.\\nSome of these are procedural.\\nThus the detention of persons of unsound mind under article 5(1)(e), even if formally authorised, must be regularly reviewed in order to ensure that the criteria for detention still exist: see X v United Kingdom (1982) 4 EHRR 118.\\nA principle of domestic law which allows people to be de facto detained without any formality at all contravenes article 5(1)(e) (as well as article 5(4)) even though the criteria for detention do exist: see HL v United Kingdom (2005) 40 EHRR 761.\\nThe Strasbourg court has not yet (so far as we are aware) addressed the procedural protection which may be required in order to prevent detention by the executive under article 5(1)(f) becoming arbitrary.\\nThe notion of arbitrariness for the purpose of article 5(1)(f) is, however, different from the notion of arbitrariness for the purpose of article 5(1)(b), (d) and (e).\\nIt does not require that the detention be necessary in order to achieve the stated aim: see Chahal v United Kingdom (1997) 23 EHRR 413; Saadi v United Kingdom (2008) 47 EHRR 427.\\nBut in Chahal, the Court did endorse the Hardial Singh principles, which incorporate a reasonable time limit on the detention.\\nIt is not impossible, therefore, that the Court would also impose a requirement for regular reviews.\\nBut it cannot be assumed that it would do so, or that it would expect these to be as rigorous as those which the Secretary of State has imposed upon himself.\\nThus, while the article 5 jurisprudence does not detract from the conclusions reached on domestic law, it does not add anything to them.\\nFor those reasons, I would allow the appeal and make the order proposed by Lord Hope, although I would not hold out much hope that Mr Kambadzi will be entitled to more than a nominal sum in damages.\\nMy reasons for reaching this conclusion are, I believe, no different from those of Lord Hope and Lord Kerr.\\nBut because the Court is so narrowly divided, I thought it necessary to reason the matter through for myself.\\nThe decision in Lumba has confirmed and strengthened me in these conclusions, although I acknowledge that, as this case was presented to us, the departure from published departmental policy was of a different kind from the departure in that case.\\nNevertheless, it was so obvious and so persistent and so directly related to the decision to continue to detain that it was clearly material in the Lumba sense.\\nWhether in reality it was a Lumba case is not for this Court to decide.\\nLORD KERR\\nI agree with Lord Hope that this appeal should be allowed for the reasons that he has given.\\nI also agree that the anonymity order should be set aside.\\nAs Lord Hope has said, it may be safely assumed that an asylum seeker will be alive to the risks that disclosure of his identity will entail and his stance on the question of anonymity, especially if he expresses no desire that it be maintained, will be of importance in striking the balance between avoiding unnecessary risks to the asylum seekers safety and the principle of open justice.\\nThe critical question in this appeal is whether compliance with the duty to review underpins the legality of the detention.\\nIt is accepted that there is a duty to review.\\nIt is further accepted that this duty had not been complied with.\\nDoes that make the detention unlawful? The respondent says that it does not, arguing that the situation encountered here is not comparable to that which demands compliance with a statutory obligation on which the condition of lawfulness of the detention depends.\\nIt is suggested that a failure to observe a public law duty should not render unlawful a hitherto lawful detention because there can be no sufficient nexus between such a failure and the lawfulness of the detention.\\nOne can acknowledge the initial appeal of the respondents argument.\\nIf a statute prescribes certain conditions that must be met in order that a person may be lawfully held in detention, where one of those conditions remains unfulfilled, the detention may be regarded as automatically unlawful.\\nBy contrast, the failure to fulfil a duty owed at public law will not necessarily render invalid a detention made on foot of a valid authorisation.\\nThe essential question must be whether there is an adequate connection between compliance with the duty and the lawfulness of the detention.\\nThe respondents argument proceeds on the premise that there can never be such a close link.\\nThe appellants case is that it depends on the circumstances some public law duties are so closely linked to the continued legality of the detention that a failure to comply with them transforms it from a condition of lawfulness to one which is unlawful.\\nThe case can be approached in a relatively simplistic way.\\nThe appellant has a legal entitlement to have the justification for his detention reviewed.\\nThis is not disputed.\\nLikewise it is not challenged that where there has been a violation of that right, the appellant must have a remedy.\\nIs that remedy to be confined to a declaration and/or an injunction? And if he is entitled to these forms of relief, why should he not be entitled to maintain an action for damages for false imprisonment? Given that what is at stake is the appellants liberty; that there is a presumption in favour of his release; that scrupulous adherence to the review standards is clearly contemplated in the language of the policy document; and that, plainly, these are considered to be vital safeguards of the detainees interests, I can discern no reason in principle to restrict the availability of all remedies that the law will conventionally afford for unlawful detention.\\nOn the contrary, it appears to me that access to the full panoply of such remedies is required in order that those fundamental interests are afforded proper protection.\\nAnother way of approaching the questions that arise on the appeal is to ask whether the initial authority to detain could be regarded as comprehensive of the issues which are germane to the continued lawfulness of detention.\\nQuite clearly, detention which is lawful initially can be transformed to a condition of illegality see R v Governor of Durham Prison Ex p Hardial Singh [1984] 1 WLR 704.\\nIn his argument to this court on behalf of the Secretary of State, Mr Tam QC has asserted that where the detention is initially lawful, it cannot become unlawful, absent an undermining of the initial authority to detain.\\nBut there was no undermining of the initial authority in that sense in Hardial Singh yet the initially lawful detention became unlawful.\\nThat transformation occurred by a means other than by operation of an express statutory pre condition or by the extinction of the initial authority to detain.\\nIn Hardial Singh it was held that there were implicit limitations on the statutory power to continue to detain.\\nIf, for instance, the original purpose of detention viz to deport became incapable of fulfilment, the detainee could no longer be lawfully held.\\nWhy should implicit limitations in the form of an effective review of the continuing justification for detention not be recognised in the present case? Where someone is detained beyond the immediate post detention period, there may be two aspects to the question whether his detention is lawful.\\nFirst there must be an initial valid authorisation; secondly, there must be compliance with such public law duties as touch directly on the question of whether he should continue to be detained.\\nThat proposition can perhaps be best exemplified in the context of a review of the justification of the reasons for continued detention by considering the purpose of that review.\\nOne starts with the unexceptionable proposition that it would be indisputably unlawful to hold someone in detention if there was no justification for it.\\nSince, self evidently, an original justification for detention may prove, in light of events and circumstances that occur subsequently, to no longer obtain, periodic review of the justification for continued detention is required.\\nThe purpose of the review is to determine whether there are still good grounds to continue to hold the person in detention.\\nIf the review discloses that there are no such grounds, continued detention is unquestionably illegal.\\nA person detained after it had been shown that there was no good reason for his continued detention would undoubtedly have the right to claim compensation for false imprisonment.\\nAs Lord Hope has said, support for the proposition that a departure from published policy as to detention will render it unlawful is to be found in R (Nadarajah) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2004] INLR 139.\\nLord Brown has sought to distinguish that case from the present appeal on the basis that in Nadarajah the grounds on which the power of executive detention could be exercised had been narrowed but that no such narrowing of powers occurred here.\\nBut if the published policy in Nadarajah narrowed the grounds on which someone could be lawfully detained, why should the same consequence not accrue in the present case? In Nadarajah the stated policy was to release those whose removal was not imminent.\\nHere it is to the effect that persons will only be detained if there is continuing justification for it, as verified by a prescribed system of review.\\nLord Brown suggests that in Nadarajah the detainee was entitled to release and in the present case that the appellant was entitled 'merely' to be reviewed for release.\\nI respectfully disagree that such a distinction can be drawn.\\nThe essence of the appellant's entitlement was that he would be released unless continued justification for his detention existed.\\nThe review was the means by which the existence of the justification was to be established.\\nIt is not comprehensive of the detainee's entitlement.\\nAs in Nadarajah the appellant in the present case is entitled to be released in accordance with the terms of the relevant policy, if justification for his continued detention no longer obtains.\\nWhat if no review takes place? If it is illegal to hold a person in detention where it has been established that there are no good grounds for doing so, can it be lawful to hold someone without examining whether such grounds continue to exist? In my view it cannot.\\nSince it has been recognised that, in cases such as the appellants, periodic review is necessary in order to vouch the continued justification for detention, where that review does not take place, the detention can no longer be considered justified.\\nThe justification for continued detention cannot be said to exist and, absent such justification, the detention is unlawful.\\nLikewise, in my opinion, where the review does take place but does not partake of the quality or character required to justify the continuance of detention, it becomes unlawful and gives rise to a right to claim false imprisonment.\\nI believe that Munby J was right in his characterisation of the system of review as being integral to the lawfulness of the detention (para 68 of his judgment).\\nIt was not only so stated in the policy document, this concept pervades the entire approach of government to this type of detention.\\nI accept, of course, that the Executive cannot make law and that the policy document should not be construed as a statute but it is not irrelevant that the Home Secretary made an unequivocal statement that failure to comply with the policy would be a breach of the law.\\nThis surely provides the foundation for a finding that the requirement of review is intimately connected to the continuing lawfulness of the detention and that it therefore constitutes an implicit limitation on the statutory power to detain.\\nThe majority in R (Lumba and Mighty) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2011] UKSC 12; [2011] 2 WLR 671, has held that causation is not a necessary ingredient for liability.\\nIn that case the argument on behalf of the detained persons was put in this way: a public law error that bears directly on the decision to detain will mean that the authority for detention is ultra vires and unlawful, and will sound in false imprisonment.\\nThat argument was accepted by the majority of the court in Lumba.\\nThe public law error in the present case bore directly on the decision to detain in that it was made without the necessary review of the justification for detention.\\nAs the majority in Lumba also held, however, causation is relevant to the question of the recoverability of damages.\\nFor the reasons that I gave in my judgment in that case, I consider that if it can be shown that the claimant would not have been released if a proper review had been carried out, this must have an impact on the quantum of compensation and that nominal damages only will be recoverable.\\nLORD BROWN (with whom Lord Rodger agrees)\\nDoes a failure to comply with a published policy periodically to review the exercise of a statutory power of executive detention constitute not merely the breach of a public law duty but in addition the tort of false imprisonment? Does it, in other words, undermine the lawfulness of continuing detention? That essentially is the issue before the Court on this appeal.\\nLord Hopes judgment contains a very full account of the facts, the arguments and the authorities relevant to this appeal so that my own judgment can be correspondingly short.\\nThe Immigration Act 1971, as amended, (the 1971 Act) provides (by paragraphs 2(2) and (3) of Schedule 3) that, in a case like this, once notice of intention to deport has been given, the Secretary of State may detain the person pending the making of the deportation order (paragraph 2(2)) and, once the deportation order has been made, the detainee shall continue to be detained [pending his removal or departure] unless he is released on bail or the Secretary of State directs otherwise (paragraph 2(3)).\\nOne suspects that when these provisions were enacted nearly 40 years ago Parliament envisaged the deportation process taking place within a comparatively short timescale, perhaps months at most.\\nAs it is, however, the process regularly stretches to years and not infrequently the position arises where, for one reason or another, it proves impossible for a considerable time to deport anyone to a particular country because of conditions there.\\nIn the past this has been true at various times of Somalia, of Afghanistan, of Iraq, and of Kosovo.\\nSince 2005 it has also been true of Zimbabwe which is why this appellant, although given notice of an intention to deport him on 8 March 2006, and made subject to a deportation order on 24 August 2007, remains in this country to this day.\\nMore particularly, this is the background to his detention under Schedule 3 to the 1971 Act (following completion of a prison sentence) from 8 March 2006 to 13 June 2008 when, after 27 months of Schedule 3 detention, he was finally released on bail.\\nThat the Secretary of States power to detain people under paragraph 2 of Schedule 3 (the paragraph 2 power as for convenience I shall call it) is not unlimited is plain and undisputed.\\nThis was first established by Woolf J in R v Governor of Durham Prison Ex p Hardial Singh [1984] 1 WLR 704, approved by the Privy Council in Tan Te Lam v Superintendent of Tai A Chau Detention Centre [1997] AC 97 and subsequently distilled by Dyson LJ in R (I) v Secretary of State for the Home Department) [2003] INLR 196, para 46 into four propositions (which, again for convenience, I shall call the Hardial Singh principles), as follows: (i) The Secretary of State must intend to deport the person and can only use the power to detain for that purpose. (ii) The deportee may only be detained for a period that is reasonable in all the circumstances. (iii) If, before the expiry of the reasonable period, it becomes apparent that the Secretary of State will not be able to effect deportation within that reasonable period, he should not seek to exercise the power of detention. (iv) The Secretary of State should act with reasonable diligence and expedition to effect removal.\\nAlthough suggested by the appellant to be broadly similar to the protections implied by the ECtHR into article 5(1)(f) of the Convention to ensure proportionality and guard against arbitrariness, to my mind the Hardial Singh principles, certainly as applied in a succession of later cases, are in fact more favourable to detainees than Strasbourg requires.\\nIn particular Strasbourg has consistently stated that there is no requirement that the detention be reasonably considered necessary, for example to prevent the person concerned from committing an offence or fleeing (para 72 of the Grand Chambers judgment in Saadi v UK (2008) 47 EHRR 427, following Chahal v UK (1996) 23 EHRR 413, para 112).\\nDomestic case law, by contrast, holds that with regard to the second Hardial Singh principle the deportee may only be detained for a period that is reasonable in all circumstances [t]he likelihood or otherwise of the detainee absconding and/or re offending [is] an obviously relevant circumstance (my judgment in I at para 29, echoed by Dyson LJ at paras 48 and 49).\\nI may note at this point that, notwithstanding that the full width of the Hardial Singh principles was clearly recognised by Munby J in the present case (paras 79 120), his conclusion was that none of them had been breached at any time, a conclusion unchallenged in the Court of Appeal.\\nIt follows that not merely was the appellant in a formal sense a person liable to be detained under the third Schedule (in the same way that the unsuccessful appellant in R (Khadir) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2006] 1 AC 207 was held liable to detention and thus eligible for temporary admission under the second Schedule even though it might well have been unreasonable and in breach of the Hardial Singh principles actually to have detained him); here the appellant was liable to be detained in the fuller sense that throughout the period of his detention it would have been a lawful and reasonable exercise of the paragraph 2 power actually to detain him.\\nOn what basis, then, is it said that the appellants detention was unlawful so as to give rise to a claim for damages for false imprisonment? The argument revolves around the Secretary of States published policy: chapter 38 of the Departments Operations Enforcement Manual (the OEM) under the heading Detention and Temporary Release.\\nThe policy (at 38.3) includes a presumption in favour of temporary admission or temporary release, provides that [t]here must be strong grounds for believing that a person will not comply with conditions of temporary admission or temporary release for detention to be justified and that [a]ll reasonable alternatives to detention must be considered before detention is authorised, and dictates that [o]nce detention has been authorised, it must be kept under close review to ensure that it continues to be justified.\\nParagraph 38.8 then specifies how both the initial detention and any continued detention thereafter are to be authorised and kept under review, expressly providing both for the frequency and for the level of seniority of the reviews required.\\nIn the event, as Munby J recorded (para 48), although entitled (by the date of the first instance hearing) to no fewer than 22 monthly reviews of the lawfulness of his detention, the appellant had had the benefit of only ten reviews, of which only six were conducted by officials of the requisite seniority, and of those six, two had had to be disavowed as fatally flawed.\\nParagraph 38.1 of the policy, headed General, states: To be lawful, detention must not only be based on one of the statutory powers and accord with the limitations implied by domestic and Strasbourg case law but must also accord with this stated policy.\\nIn a sense the question now before us is quite simply: is that statement accurate? Munby J in effect held that it was, not only as to the substantive requirements to justify continuing detention but as to the review requirements also.\\nAt para 68 of his judgment, having referred to rule 9(1) of the Detention Centre Rules (which, like Lord Hope, I think to be of only peripheral relevance) he continued: [I]ntegral to the policy laid down by the Secretary of State in paragraph 38.8 of the Operations Enforcement Manual, is the principle that someone is not to be detained beyond a certain period without there being a review undertaken at regular intervals and moreover, as required by the Secretary of States policy, a review undertaken at increasingly high levels of seniority within the Home Office as the period of detention grows longer.\\nThose reviews are fundamental to the propriety of the continuing detention, they are required in order to ensure that the continuing detention can still be justified in the light of current, and perhaps changed, circumstances, and they are, in my judgment, a necessary prerequisite to the continuing legality of the detention.\\nThat paragraph identifies the critical question: is the holding of the reviews required by the OEM a necessary prerequisite to the continuing legality of the detention? In addressing this question it is convenient first to distinguish the present case from certain other authorities strongly relied upon by the respective parties.\\nThe appellant (supported by the Intervener) seeks to pray in aid the Court of Appeals decision in Roberts v Chief Constable of the Cheshire Constabulary [1999] 1 WLR 662.\\nThe case turned on the proper construction of Part IV of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (the Part containing each of the sections to which I now refer).\\nThe detainee, following arrest, was initially kept in police detention pursuant to section 37.\\nSection 40(1) provided that: Reviews of the detention of each person in police detention in connection with the investigation of an offence shall be carried out periodically in accordance with the following provisions of this section.\\nSection 40(3)(a) provided that the first review shall be not later than six hours after the detention was first authorised.\\nCentral to the decision that, no such review within six hours having taken place, the detainees continued detention (until the point two hours, twenty minutes later when his detention was reviewed) had been unlawful (notwithstanding that had he been reviewed at the six hour point he clearly would still have been detained), was section 34(1) which provided that: A person arrested for an offence shall not be kept in police detention except in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Act.\\nMunby J appears to have thought Roberts strongly supportive of the appellants case.\\nLaws LJ, giving the leading judgment in the Court of Appeal, thought otherwise.\\nAs he pointed out ([2009] 1 WLR 1527, para 25): [T]he requirement of periodic review, on the proper construction of the statute, had to be satisfied as a condition precedent to the legality of the suspects detention.\\nIt was made so by the express terms of section 34(1).\\nBut there is no analogue to section 34(1) of PACE to be found in paragraph 2(2) of Schedule 3 to the Immigration Act 1971.\\nThere is no reference in the sub paragraph, express or implied, to the Rules or the manual or to any Rules that might be made under powers in the Immigration Act or to any manual, or instructions, that might be issued by the Secretary of State.\\nI cannot see how compliance with the letter of the Rules or manual could be said to be a sine qua non of a lawful exercise of the power to detain unless paragraph 2(2) (or other main legislation) made it so.\\nBut it does not.\\nI agree with Laws LJ that Roberts provides little if any assistance to the appellant here.\\nThe respondent for his part seeks to rely on R (Walker) v Secretary of State for Justice (Parole Board intervening) [2010] 1 AC 553 in support of his argument that a failure in the review process does not undermine the legality of (the unreviewed) continuing detention.\\nWalker was concerned with a number of appeals by IPP prisoners justifiably complaining of the Secretary of States systemic failures to provide the necessary resources and systems to enable such prisoners to demonstrate to the Parole Board that they could safely be released.\\nThe Divisional Court held in one of the cases, R (Wells) Parole Board [2008] 1 All ER 138, para 47: To the extent that the prisoner remains incarcerated after tariff expiry without any current and effective assessment of the danger he does or does not pose, his detention cannot in reason be justified.\\nIt is therefore unlawful.\\nThe Court of Appeal and the House of Lords disagreed.\\nAs I put it (at paras 36 37): It is one thing to say as, indeed, is now undisputed that the Secretary of State was in breach (even systemic breach) of his public law duty to provide such courses as would enable IPP prisoners to demonstrate their safety for release and, to some extent at least, courses enabling them to reduce the risk they pose, duties inherent in the legislation (the legislations underlying premise [as it was described in the court below]); quite another to say that such breach of duty results in detention being unlawful.\\nI respectfully agree with the Court of Appeal that it does not.\\nThe remedy for such breach of public law duty indeed the only remedy, inadequate though in certain respects it may be is declaratory relief condemning the Secretary of States failures and indicating that he is obliged to do more.\\nBy the same token, submits Mr Tam QC, the undisputed (and here too systemic) breaches of the Secretary of States public law duty to review, consistently with his published policy, the justifiability of the appellants (and doubtless very many other detainees) continuing detention, although (as in Walker) deeply to be regretted and strongly to be condemned, does not result in the unreviewed detention being unlawful.\\nTo my mind, however, Walker is no more helpful to the respondents case than Roberts is to the appellants.\\nAgain, as in Walker, the primary legislation made the position clear: IPP prisoners were expressly made subject to the statutory requirement (under section 28 of the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997) that they were not to be released until the Parole Board was satisfied that their continuing confinement was no longer necessary for the protection of the public.\\nIn the same way that Schedule 3 to the 1971 Act contains no analogue to section 34(1) of PACE, so too it contains no analogue to section 28 of the 1997 Act.\\nLaws LJ below identified (at para 21) the essential question here to be: What is the reach [of the paragraph 2 power] and characterised it as a question of statutory construction.\\nAt paragraph 35 he summarised his conclusions upon the question as follows: (i) Compliance with the Rules and manual as such is not a condition precedent to a lawful detention pursuant to paragraph 2(2).\\nStatute does not make it so (contrast section 34(1) of PACE, and the Roberts case [1999] 1 WLR 662).\\nNor does the common law, or the law of the Convention. (ii) Avoidance of the vice of arbitrary detention by use of the power conferred by paragraph 2(2) requires that in every case the Hardial Singh principles should be complied with. (iii) It is elementary that the power exercised, being an act of the executive, is subject to the control of the courts, principally by way of judicial review.\\nSo much is also required by Convention article 5(4).\\nThe focus of judicial supervision in the particular context is upon the vindication of the Hardial Singh principles. (iv) In the event of a legal challenge to any particular case the Secretary of State must be in a position to demonstrate by evidence that those principles have been and are being fulfilled.\\nHowever the law does not prescribe the form of such evidence.\\nCompliance with the Rules and the manual would be an effective and practical means of doing so.\\nIt is anyway the Secretary of States duty so to comply.\\nIt is firmly to be expected that hereafter that will be conscientiously done.\\nMr Raza Husains attack upon that paragraph centres upon the proposition that, following the initial exercise of the paragraph 2 power, the Secretary of State has a continuing discretion whether to maintain the detention and is under a duty to exercise that discretion regularly in accordance with the published policy.\\nSo much Mr Tam accepts and, indeed, he further accepts that every failure to review a detention by the specified time or by the specified level of decision maker constitutes a breach of the Secretary of States public law duty.\\nOf course, as Mr Husain recognises, not all breaches of public law duties arising in the context of detention would render its continuation unlawful see, for example, Cullen v Chief Constable of the Royal Ulster Constabulary [2003] 1 WLR 1763.\\nThe key question, he submits, is whether the breach is sufficiently closely linked to the detention decision.\\nHere, he contends, it plainly was.\\nThe authority (Roberts aside) upon which Mr Husain principally relies is the decision of the Court of Appeal in R (Nadarajah) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2004] INLR 139 (a report dealing also with Amirthanathans appeal I shall call them respectively N and A).\\nThat case too concerned the Secretary of States detention policy under chapter 38 of the OEM but not, as here, the review provisions rather the statement that one of the reasons for detaining an asylum seeker is that his removal from the UK is imminent.\\nWhat was not part of the published policy and so was not publicly known was the Departments further policy, when considering the imminence of removal, to disregard information from those acting for asylum seekers that proceedings were about to be instituted, however credible that information might be.\\nNs solicitors had given notice of his intention to seek judicial review of the Secretary of States decision to certify his case as manifestly unfounded.\\nAs solicitors similarly had notified his intention to exercise his right of appeal against the Secretary of States rejection of his Human Rights Act claim to remain.\\nThe detentions of both on the ground that their removal was imminent were held unlawful.\\nIt was, said the Court of Appeal (at para 68), at odds with [the Secretary of States] policy, as made public.\\nAdditionally, in As case, it was clear that he had in fact been kept detained so as to facilitate the obtaining of the documentation needed for his removal.\\nThis too was at odds with the Secretary of States policy, as made public (para 72).\\nI confess that for a time I was persuaded by the appellants argument and thought it supported by the authority of Nadarajah.\\nIn the end, however, I have reached the contrary view.\\nNadarajah now seems to me clearly distinguishable.\\nNot because, as the Court of Appeal noted in that case at para 69, had Ns solicitor been aware of the Secretary of States unpublished policy she would have instituted judicial review proceedings earlier, so that the departure from the published policy was in fact causative of Ns continued detention.\\nRather Nadarajah is distinguishable because it is one thing, as there, to adopt a published policy which in substance narrows the grounds on which an executive power of detention is exercisable (the stated policy there being to release those whose removal was not imminent); quite another, as here, to have a policy and programme for review which dictates only the procedure whereby detention will regularly be reviewed.\\nIn the former case, under the published policy the detainee was entitled to release; in the latter case, he was not he was entitled merely to be reviewed for release.\\nNaturally, upon the intended reviews, the detainee would be released if, as a matter of substance, his continuing detention were found no longer justifiable according to the published policy.\\nThe difference, however, seems to me crucial.\\nIn the one case a breach of policy renders continuing detention unlawful.\\nIn the other it does not.\\nLady Hale, at para 72 of her judgment, suggests an analogy between the present case and Christie v Leachinsky [1947] AC 573 which established the common law requirement that an arrested person be told, at the time, the reason for his arrest.\\nFor my part I find the suggestion unpersuasive.\\nAs Lady Hale herself observes, the requirement was imposed for the very good reason that the arrested person had to know whether or not he was entitled to resist arrest.\\nLord Simonds put it thus (p591): it is the corollary of the right of every citizen to be thus free from arrest [unless, that is, someone has the right to arrest him] that he should be entitled to resist arrest unless that arrest is lawful.\\nHow can these rights be reconciled with the proposition that he may be arrested without knowing why he is arrested? and a little later (p.592): . the subject is entitled to know why he is deprived of his freedom, if only in order that he may, without a moments delay, take such steps as will enable him to regain it.\\nNo such consideration arises or could arise in the present content.\\nTheir Lordships in Christie v Leachinsky would, I think, be astonished at the suggestion that any failure to give effect to a self imposed requirement for periodic review of the continuing detention of those awaiting deportation similarly renders that detention unlawful.\\nI fear that they would be scarcely less surprised by the further suggestion (at para 77 of Lady Hales judgment) that, assuming such detention to be unlawful, it is to be compensated by no more than a nominal sum in damages.\\nIndeed it seems to me that that very suggestion illustrates the ineptness of the proposed analogy between the two cases in the first place.\\nThe majoritys proposed solution to this case would quite simply devalue the whole concept of false imprisonment.\\nNothing that I have said should be taken to depreciate the desirability and importance of reviews under chapter 38 nor to excuse the Departments lamentable failures to conduct them, certainly in the appellants case and very probably in a host of others.\\nAs the courts below rightly observed, these matters go to the liberty of the subject and the picture which emerges is deeply disturbing, indeed profoundly shocking (Munby J, para 137).\\nOne obvious consequence of such serial failures is that it creates a substantially greater risk of detainees bringing successful proceedings for breach of the Hardial Singh principles (or, indeed, assuming they are still more favourable to detainees, the Secretary of States published policy statements going to the substantive criteria for release, as in Nadarajah itself) principles and statements to which the reviews are intended and likely to give effect.\\nAnd, of course, as the Hardial Singh line of authority (and, indeed, Nadarajah) clearly establishes, a successful claim on these grounds carries with it a right to damages for false imprisonment, a right to damages, moreover, which, unlike that arising upon a failure to review such as envisaged by the majority (and, indeed, such as arose in Roberts see p669H), would naturally be untroubled by any question of causation.\\nI recognise, of course, that, on this approach, it is only in cases where the detainee can show that he should have been released that the respondent will be required to pay, financially, for failures in the review process.\\nWhere, as here, all that can be shown is a series of public law breaches failures to comply with his own published policy as to reviews the only remedy, as in Walker, is by way of declaratory relief.\\nUnsatisfactory though in one way this is, to treat a failure in the review process (perhaps merely a review held a day late or by someone of insufficient seniority and perhaps in respect of an obviously dangerous detainee) as of itself giving rise (as in Roberts) to a claim for false imprisonment would to my mind be unsatisfactory too.\\nThere may well be altogether too many people (above all children and other likewise vulnerable people) locked up awaiting deportation.\\nPlainly a wise Secretary of State would instigate and operate a practicable and robust system for minimising the use made of the paragraph 2 power.\\nAs it is, like any other public body failing to comply with their published policy, he commits a breach of his public law duty, always a regrettable state of affairs.\\nThat said, however, a detainee, once properly detained, in my opinion remains lawfully imprisoned unless and until released on bail or by the Secretary of States direction or he establishes an entitlement to release pursuant to the Hardial Singh principles or other substantive policy statements governing how the Secretary of State will exercise his paragraph 2 power.\\nThis appellant could establish no such entitlement.\\nIn my judgment he remained lawfully imprisoned until he was bailed.\\nIt will be noted that I have not hitherto referred to article 5(1)(f) of the Convention save only to observe (at para 94) that domestic law is in fact more favourable to detainees awaiting deportation than Strasbourg requires.\\nSince it now appears that this is to be a minority judgment, I need say no more than that there is nothing in the existing Strasbourg jurisprudence which would warrant a conclusion that a failure to give effect to the Secretary of States self imposed requirement for detention reviews would result in unlawful detention under the Convention irrespective of whether it constitutes false imprisonment under the common law. (I do not think I am in disagreement with the majority as to this see, for example, para 76 of Lady Hales judgment.) Nor, of course, is there any question here of a breach of article 5(4) of the Convention: the requirements of that provision are amply satisfied by the detainees right to seek bail or, indeed, judicial review.\\nI would dismiss this appeal.\\nThe above (paras 90 113) is the judgment I wrote before an enlarged court of nine of us in November 2010 heard, and subsequently, on 23 March 2011, gave judgment in, R (Lumba and Mighty) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2011] UKSC 12; [2011] 2 WLR 671 (Lumba).\\nGiven that a majority of the court (6:3) held that the particular public law breaches committed by the Secretary of State there resulted in the appellants being falsely imprisoned albeit a differently constituted majority (also 6:3) held that they can recover no more than nominal damages should I (must I) now change my judgment and agree with the majority that Mr Kambadzi too was falsely imprisoned?\\nI have concluded not: it by no means follows from the majority view on liability in Lumba that there is liability here too and to my mind it would be still more undesirable to find liability established here than the minority of us thought it to be in Lumba itself.\\nThat the two cases are different is plain enough.\\nAs Lord Dyson observed in para 61 of his lead judgment: A somewhat similar problem arose in R (SK Zimbabwe) v Secretary of State for the Home Department In that case the unlawfulness lay in the failure of the Secretary of State to comply with her policy which prescribed the procedural requirements for reviews of FNPs who are already in detention.\\nThe present case concerns the substantive requirements for the initial detention of FNPs as well as their continued detention.\\nLady Hale too (para 198) recognised that on the issue of liability Lumba is a stronger case than is still before the court in SK (Zimbabwe) because the illegality alleged (and now admitted) went to the criteria for detention rather than to the procedure for authorising it.\\nAlthough, obviously, the court in Lumba was not required to consider the consequences in terms of liability of a public law failure to comply with the Secretary of States self imposed requirements for the review of continuing detention, there appear to me a number of passages in the judgments of those holding liability to be established there, strongly suggesting that they might well have taken a very different view in the present case.\\nThis is perhaps plainest at paras 193 and 194 of Lord Walkers judgment: It is a big step to extend the [Anisminic] principle to a claim for damages for false imprisonment, where a defendant may have his professional reputation at stake and may not enjoy the procedural protections which attend judicial review (strict time limits, and the discretionary nature of the remedy granted).\\nI would prefer a more demanding test, that in a case where an extant statutory power to detain has been wrongly used there would be a private law claim only if the misuse amounted to an abuse of power (including but not limited to cases of misfeasance or other conscious misuse of power). 194 However, it is in my opinion unnecessary to decide the point in these appeals because the conduct of officials, including some senior officials, of the Home Office between April 2006 and September 2008 amounted to a serious abuse of power.\\nLord Dyson SCJ has . described in restrained language how senior officials were well aware of the risk (indeed the likelihood) of challenge and decided to run the risk, (including the proposal to let immigration judges take any hit), and how further damaging facts were disclosed by stages, some before Davis J, some before the Court of Appeal and some only in this court.\\nWherever the line is to be drawn (if, as I think, a line does need to be drawn between public law errors in detention policies which do or do not give rise to an action for false imprisonment) these appeals must in my view fall on the wrong side of the line from the Secretary of States point of view.\\nGiven that a line is to be drawn between public law errors amounting to the sort of serious misconduct which Lord Walker was clearly intending to denote by his use of the expression abuse of power and other public law errors which do not give rise to actions for false imprisonment, it is very far from obvious that Lord Walker would regard the failures in the review process here as an abuse of power.\\nLord Collins too, having referred (at para 220) to the Home Offices deliberate decision . to continue an unlawful policy and to the cynical nature of its approach generally in these cases, expressed himself (at para 221) satisfied that the serious breach of public law in this case has the result that the detention of the appellants was unlawful (emphasis added).\\nEven Lord Dyson (para 68) expressly accepted that: It is not every breach of public law that is sufficient to give rise to a cause of action in false imprisonment.\\nIn the present context, the breach of public law must bear on and be relevant to the decision to detain.\\nThus, for example, the decision to detain made by an official of a different grade from that specified in a detention policy would not found a claim in false imprisonment.\\nIt seems clear, therefore, that Lord Dyson would have rejected Mr Kambadzis case at least in respect of the four monthly reviews carried out by officials of the wrong grade although, I acknowledge, it is unclear what conclusion he would have reached with regard to the twelve omitted reviews.\\nOf course, the three of us who dissented on liability in Lumba would by definition conclude that Mr Kambadzi must fail on liability in the present case.\\nAs for why, liability in Lumba notwithstanding, it would be wrong to find false imprisonment established here too, let me illustrate what seems to me the absurdity of such conclusion by the example I gave (at para 357) in Lumba: it would result in a detainee whose detention is reviewed every second month instead of monthly as the published policy dictates, alternat[ing] yo yo like between lawful detention and false imprisonment.\\nTo hold that false imprisonment is the consequence of a failure to comply with the substantive requirements for the initial detention of FNPs as well as their continued detention (Lord Dyson at para 61, quoted above) is one thing; to hold that the same consequence follows a failure to comply with the procedural requirements for reviews of FNPs who are already in detention (ibid) is quite another and to my mind a step altogether too far.\\nI therefore remain of the view, the authority of Lumba notwithstanding, that this appeal should be dismissed.\\nOn the issue of anonymity I agree with Lord Hope.\\nAs was recently established by the Courts comprehensive and authoritative judgment given by Lord Rodger in In re Guardian News and Media Ltd [2010] 2 AC 697, the general rule is that parties to proceedings are named and that an anonymity order has to be justified.\\nIn my opinion there is no justification for such an order here and, indeed, Mr Husain on behalf of the appellant suggests none and seeks no such order.\\nThere may, of course, be good reason in certain asylum cases for maintaining the asylum seekers anonymity notwithstanding that his claim fails: the very fact of his having made a claim, albeit unsuccessful, could on occasion tip the balance and give rise to a genuine fear of persecution or article 3 ill treatment where previously none existed.\\nDoubtless in any such case counsel, certainly counsel as expert and experienced as Mr Husain, would duly seek the necessary anonymity order.\\nGiven, however, that this appellants asylum claim was clearly bogus, it is unsurprising that no such application was made here and it is to my mind inconceivable that the appellants known involvement in these proceedings could give rise to any bona fide further asylum claim.\\n\""

              "'The issue in this appeal is whether a failure by the Respondent to comply with a procedural requirement in its policy relating to the detention of foreign national prisoners results in their detention being unlawful, so as to allow the detainee to advance a claim in tort for false imprisonment.\\nShepherd Masimba Kambadzi is a Zimbabwean national.\\nHe entered the UK lawfully, but remained here after his leave to remain expired.\\nIn 2005, he was convicted of assault and sexual assault, sentenced to one years imprisonment and ordered to be registered as a sex offender for five years.\\nPrior to his being released from prison, the Respondent decided to make a deportation order against the Appellant.\\nParagraph 2(2) of Schedule 3 to the Immigration Act 1971 (the 1971 Act) gives the Secretary of State the power to detain foreign nationals pending the making of a deportation order and the Appellant was detained under that power on 7 March 2006.\\nOn 24 August 2007, a deportation order was made against the Appellant, after which he was detained under paragraph 2(3) of Schedule 3 to the 1971 Act.\\nIn all, he was detained for 27 months until 13 June 2008, when he was granted bail.\\nHe has not yet been returned to Zimbabwe because of conditions in that country.\\nThe common law has recognised limits on the extent of the power to detain under paragraphs 2(2) and (3) of Schedule 3 to the 1971 Act (the Hardial Singh principles, set down in R v Governor of Durham Prison Ex p Hardial Singh [1984] 1 WLR 904).\\nThe Respondent had a policy which detailed how the power to detain was to be exercised.\\nIt provided, for example, that all reasonable alternatives to detention must be considered before detention was authorised.\\nThe policy also provided for detention to be subject to review at regular intervals.\\nIt specified the frequency of review and the grade of official which was to carry them out.\\nThe policy required the Appellants detention to be reviewed on five occasions during the first month and then monthly thereafter.\\nThe Appellants detention was not reviewed in accordance with that policy.\\nBy the date of the first instance hearing of this claim, he had been entitled to 22 monthly reviews of the lawfulness of his detention, in addition to the five reviews which should have taken place in the first month.\\nHis detention had been reviewed only ten times.\\nOnly six of those reviews had been conducted by officials of the required seniority and, of those six, two were flawed by material errors of fact.\\nThe substantive requirements for detaining the Appellant were, however, met throughout the period of his detention: had the Respondent carried out the reviews, it could justifiably have decided to continue to detain him.\\nWhile still detained, the Appellant raised a judicial review, seeking a declaration that he was unlawfully detained and damages.\\nAt first instance, Munby J granted a declaration that the Appellant had been unlawfully detained for various periods amounting to about 19 months and gave directions for the assessment of damages, but he declined to order his release. (The Appellant was subsequently granted bail in other proceedings.) The Court of Appeal allowed the Secretary of States appeal and held that the Appellants detention had been lawful throughout.\\nAlthough the Supreme Court heard the appeal in February 2010, it delayed handing down its judgment so as to be enable a court of nine Justices to consider the case of R (Lumba) v Secrteary of State for the\\nHome Department [2011] UKSC 12.\\nThat case also considered the legality of the detention of foreign national prisoners where the Secretary of State has not complied with the terms of the published policy relating to detention.\\nThe Supreme Court, by a majority, allows the appeal.\\nLord Hope gives the leading judgment; Lady Hale and Lord Kerr issue separate concurring judgments.\\nThe majority holds that the Appellants detention was unlawful for the periods in respect of which no review was carried out and that he does have a claim in tort for false imprisonment in respect of those periods.\\nThe amount of damages is yet to be ascertained, but will be nominal if it is found that the Appellant would have been detained even if his detention had been reviewed as the policy required.\\nLord Brown gives a dissenting judgment, with which Lord Rodger agrees.\\nThe Secretary of State was under a public law duty to adhere to the terms of the policy relating to reviews unless there were good reasons not to: [36], [39], [66].\\nThe majority of the Court holds that the Respondents unlawful failure to review the Appellants detention, as required by the policy, resulted in his detention being unlawful.\\nThe court rejects the argument that because the breach of public law related to a procedural requirement, it did not affect the legality of the detention: [69] [73], [85].\\nSome procedural requirements go to the legality of the detention and some do not: [71].\\nThe policy was sufficiently closely related to the authority to detain to qualify the Secretary of States discretion under the 1971 Act: [51].\\nThe very point of the review was to ensure that the detention was lawful: [73], [86].\\nThe public law error bore directly on the decision to detain the Appellant and therefore satisfied the test adopted by the majority in Lumba for determining when a public law error will result in detention being unlawful: [42], [88].\\nThe Appellants detention was not unlawful, however, where the only defect in the decision to continue detention was that the review had been carried out by an official of the wrong grade: [60].\\nAs the Court also held in Lumba, it was no defence to the claim that there were grounds which justified the Appellants detention: [54], [73], [88].\\nFalse imprisonment is a trespass to the person and actionable in itself, without proof of loss or damage: [74].\\nThe result of the reviews which should have taken place is, however, relevant to assessing damages.\\nA defendant is liable only for the loss which his wrongful act has caused.\\nThe full facts of this case are yet to be established, but if it is found that the claimant would not have been released had proper reviews been carried out, he will only be entitled to nominal damages: [55] [56], [74], [89].\\nLord Brown (with whom Lord Rodger agrees) would have held that the failure to review the Appellants detention did not result in the Appellants detention being unlawful.\\nThey hold that the policy did not confer upon the Appellant an entitlement to be released, but only an entitlement to be reviewed for release: [107].\\nOnce properly detained, a detainee remains lawfully imprisoned unless and until released on bail or by the Secretary of States direction, or he establishes a substantive entitlement to release: [111].\\nLumba does not compel the majoritys result, because it was concerned with a substantive entitlement under the policy and not a procedural one, and because it also held that not every breach of public law resulted in detention being unlawful: [116] [118].\\n'"

Later on, it was merged with other States and as a result of that merger, the Matsya Union was formed on March 18, 1948. One of the provisions of the merger agreement was that the existing laws in the Covenanting States were to be continued till such time as they were modified or repealed by the new State and that all the assets and liabilities of the Covenanting States were taken over by the new State. Later on, the Matsya Union was merged with the United State of Rajasthan which had come into existence from April 7, 1949. A similar provision with regard to the recognition of the liabilities of the Covenanting States by the new State was also provided. On January 26, 1950, Part B State of Rajasthan came into existence. In the four appeals the respondents secured permits from the Dholpur State for the export of certain commodities and they had to pay export duties in advance. As the respondents could not export the full quantity for which they had secured permits they asked the appellant to refund the excess export duty and when the latter refused to do so, filed suits for refund of the same with interest. The defence taken up by the appellant was that it was not bound by any liability which might have arisen against the former State of Dholpur. It was a new Sovereign and was not bound by any liability of the former State of Dholpur unless it chose to recognise the obligation but no such obligation was recognised in the present case. One suit was dismissed by the trial court and other three were decreed. The appeals of the State to the District Judge were substantially dismissed while the appeal in the first suit by the plaintiff was substantially allowed. The State filed appeals to the High Court. After referring the matter to the Full Bench, a Division Ben oh of the High Court dismissed the appeals filed by the State. The Appellant came to this Court after obtaining certificate of fitness from the High Court. The only question raised before this Court was about the liability of the State of Rajasthan under article 295(2) of the Constitution in respect of the obligations of the former State of Dholpur which came to be included in the State of Rajasthan. Dismissing the appeals, Held, that the new State by continuing the old laws without change till they were repealed or altered, recognised that it was liable in the same way as the merging State would have been in any case. Throughout the process of integration from 1948 to 1950, the new Sovereign must be taken to have recognised the rights of the subjects and undertaken the liabilities 175 of the old State. So under article 295(2) of the Constitution, the State of Rajasthan was liable to meet the liabilities of all old States which eventually were merged into it. Moreover, there was nothing to show that the right to claim the refund was taken away by any law competently passed. M/s Dalmia Dadri Cement Co. Limited vs The Commissioner of Income tax [1959], S.C.R. 729 and Maharaja Shree Umaid Mill Limited vs Union of India, A.I.R. 1953, S.C. 953 referred to.\",\n          \"The appellants and the respondents were owners of adjoining collieries and the suit out of which the present appeal arose was one brought by the respondents for certain reliefs on the allegation that the appellants had encroached upon their coal mines and removed coal from the encroached portion and that they came to know of the said encroachment and removal of coal after they had received the letter dated August 18, 1941, from the Inspector of Mines. The appellant denied the encroachment and pleaded that the suit was barred by limitation inasmuch as the respondents had knowledge of the encroachment in 1932 then there was a survey by the Department of Mines. The trial judge found on evidence that the proceedings in 1932 had nothing to do with the matter, held that article 48 of the Limitation Act applied to the suit and that the appellants had failed to prove that the respondents had knowledge of the sinking of the quarries and pits in the encroached land and decreed the suit. The High Court on appeal accepted the finding of the trial court and although it placed the burden of proving knowledge on the part of the respondents beyond the prescribed time on the appellants, nevertheless proceeded on the assumption that the initial burden to prove that they had knowledge of the said encroachment within the period was on the respondents and affirmed the decree of the trial court. Held, that the burden of proof had not been misplaced. Under article 48 of the Indian Limitation Act, which prescribes a three years ' limitation from the date of the knowledge, the initial onus is obviously on the plaintiff to prove that date since it would be within his special knowledge. Moreover, under section 3 of the Act, which makes its obligatory on the court to dismiss a suit barred by limitation, even though such a plea is not set up in defence, it is for the plaintiff to establish that the suit is not so barred. Lalchand Marwari vs Mahant Rampur Gir, pat. (P.C.) 312 and Rajah Sahib Perhalad Seim vs Maharajah Rajender Kishore Singh, (1869) 12 M.I.A. 292, referred to. Under the there is an essential distinc tion between burden of proof as a matter of law and pleading and as a matter of adducing evidence and under section 101 of the 493 Act the burden in the former sense is always on the plaintiff and never shifts, but the burden in the latter sense may according to the evidence led by the parties and presumptions of law or fact raised in their favour. Sundarji Shivji vs Secretary of State for India, Pat. 752, disapproved. Kalyani Prasad Singh vs Borrea Coal Co. Ltd., A.I.R. 1946 Cal. 123, Bank of Bombay vs Fazulbhoy Ebrahim, and Talyarkhan vs Gangadas, Bom. 848,approved. Held, further, that it is well settled that a map referred to in a lease is a part of the lease. Where, therefore, the map is drawn to scale and clearly demarcates the boundary it is not permissible to ignore it and reconstruct the boundary with reference to the revenue records. Darapali Sadagar vs jajir Ahmad, Cal. 394, referred to.\",\n          \"The appellant, a postman, and I,is father were living in the same house. Certain undelivered postal articles were re covered from an almirah in the house, the key of which was produced by the father. The appellant was tried and convicted of an offence under section 52 Post Offices Act for secreting postal articles. The appellant contended that since it had not been proved that he had been entrusted with these articles the offence under section 52 was not made out and that lie could not be held guilty of secreting as he was not in exclusive possession of these articles. Held, that entrustment was not an essential ingredient of the offence under section 52. Where the legislature intended to make entrustment an ingredient of the offence it had used appropriate words to make it clear. It had used no such words in section 52. To secrete means to hide. In a case like the present, the retention of an undelivered postal article in an almirah for an inordinately long period would be tantamount to hiding that article.
